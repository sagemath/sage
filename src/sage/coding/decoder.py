class Decoder(SageObject):
    r"""
    Abstract top-class for :class:`Decoder` objects.

    Every decoder class for linear codes (of any metric) should inherit from
    this abstract class.

    To implement a decoder, you need to:

    - inherit from :class:`Decoder`

    - call ``Decoder.__init__`` in the subclass constructor.
      Example: ``super().__init__(code, input_space, connected_encoder_name)``.
      By doing that, your subclass will have all the parameters described above initialized.

    - Then, you need to override one of decoding methods, either :meth:`decode_to_code` or
      :meth:`decode_to_message`. You can also override the optional method :meth:`decoding_radius`.

    - By default, comparison of :class:`Decoder` (using methods ``__eq__`` and ``__ne__`` ) are
      by memory reference: if you build the same decoder twice, they will be different. If you
      need something more clever, override ``__eq__`` and ``__ne__`` in your subclass.

    - As :class:`Decoder` is not designed to be instantiated, it does not have any representation
      methods. You should implement ``_repr_`` and ``_latex_`` methods in the subclass.
    """

    @classmethod
    def decoder_type(cls):
        r"""
        Return the set of types of ``self``.

        This method can be called on both an uninstantiated decoder class,
        or on an instance of a decoder class.

        The types of a decoder are a set of labels commonly associated with
        decoders which describe the nature and behaviour of the decoding
        algorithm. It should be considered as an informal descriptor but
        can be coarsely relied upon for e.g. program logic.

        The following are the most common types and a brief definition:

        ======================  ================================================
        Decoder type            Definition
        ======================  ================================================
        always-succeed          The decoder always returns a closest codeword if
                                the number of errors is up to the decoding
                                radius.
        bounded-distance        Any vector with Hamming distance at most
                                ``decoding_radius()`` to a codeword is
                                decodable to some codeword. If ``might-fail`` is
                                also a type, then this is not a guarantee but an
                                expectancy.
        complete                The decoder decodes every word in the ambient
                                space of the code.
        dynamic                 Some of the decoder's types will only be
                                determined at construction time
                                (depends on the parameters).
        half-minimum-distance   The decoder corrects up to half the minimum
                                distance, or a specific lower bound thereof.
        hard-decision           The decoder uses no information on which
                                positions are more likely to be in error or not.
        list-decoder            The decoder outputs a list of likely codewords,
                                instead of just a single codeword.
        might-fail              The decoder can fail at decoding even within its
                                usual promises, e.g. bounded distance.
        not-always-closest      The decoder does not guarantee to always return a
                                closest codeword.
        probabilistic           The decoder has internal randomness which can affect
                                running time and the decoding result.
        soft-decision           As part of the input, the decoder takes
                                reliability information on which positions are
                                more likely to be in error. Such a decoder only
                                works for specific channels.
