Watkins symmetric power `L`-function calculator

SYMPOW is a package to compute special values of symmetric power
elliptic curve `L`-functions. It can compute up to about 64 digits of
precision. This interface provides complete access to sympow, which
is a standard part of Sage (and includes the extra data files).

.. NOTE::

    Each call to ``sympow`` runs a complete
    ``sympow`` process. This incurs about 0.2 seconds
    overhead.

AUTHORS:

- Mark Watkins (2005-2006): wrote and released sympow

- William Stein (2006-03-05): wrote Sage interface

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (from sympow readme):

-  The quad-double package was modified from David Bailey's
   package: http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/

-  The ``squfof`` implementation was modified from
   Allan Steel's version of Arjen Lenstra's original LIP-based code.

-  The ``ec_ap`` code was originally written for the
   kernel of MAGMA, but was modified to use small integers when
   possible.

-  SYMPOW was originally developed using PARI, but due to licensing
   difficulties, this was eliminated. SYMPOW also does not use the
   standard math libraries unless Configure is run with the -lm
   option. SYMPOW still uses GP to compute the meshes of inverse
   Mellin transforms (this is done when a new symmetric power is added
   to datafiles).

           Before using this function for the first time for a given

========================================================================

Adding new symmetric powers:

SYMPOW keeps data for symmetric powers in the directory datafiles
If a pre-computed mesh of inverse Mellin transform values is not
available for a given symmetric power, SYMPOW will fail. The command

     sympow('-new_data 2')

will add the data the 2nd symmetric power, while

     sympow('-new_data 3d2')

will add the data for the 2nd derivative and 3rd symmetric power,

     sympow('-new_data 6d0h')

will add the data for the `0`-th derivative of the `6`-th Hecke power, and

     sympow('-new_data 4c')

will add data for the `4`-th symmetric power for curves with CM
(these need to be done separately for powers divisible by 4).

The mesh files are stored in binary form, and thus endian-ness is a
worry when moving from one platform to another.

To enable modular degree computations, the 2nd symmetric power must
be extant, and analytic rank requires derivatives of the 1st power.
