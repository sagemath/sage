Object persistence

You can load and save most Sage object to disk using the load and
save member functions and commands.

.. NOTE::

   It is impossible to save certain Sage objects to disk. For example,
   if `x` is a MAGMA object, i.e., a wrapper around an object
   that is defined in MAGMA, there is no way to save `x` to
   disk, since MAGMA doesn't support saving of individual objects to
   disk.


-  Versions: Loading and saving of objects is guaranteed to work
   even if the version of Python changes. Saved objects can be loaded
   in future versions of Python. However, if the data structure that
   defines the object, e.g., in Sage code, changes drastically (or
   changes name or disappears), then the object might not load
   correctly or work correctly.

-  Objects are zlib compressed for space efficiency.

# We define two global dictionaries `already_pickled` and

# You have the guarantee that the dictionary `already_pickled`
# (resp. `already_unpickled`) will be cleared after the complete
# pickling (resp. unpickling) process has been completed (and not
# before!).
# Apart from this, you are free to use these variables as you like.
#
# However, the standard utilisation is the following.
# The pickling method (namely ``__reduce__``) checks if the id of the
# current element appears in the dictionary `already_pickled`. If it
# does not, the methods records that this element is about to be
# pickled by adding the entry { id: True } to `already_pickled`.
# In all cases, the pickling method pickles the element and includes
# the id in the tuple of arguments that will be passed in afterwards
# to the unpickling function.
# The unpickling function then receives all the necessary information
# to reconstruct the element, together with an id.
# If this id appears as a key of the dictionary `already_unpickled`, it
# returns the corresponding value.
# Otherwise, it builds the element, adds the entry { id: element } to
# `already_unpickled` and finally returns the element.

def load(*filename, compress=True, verbose=True, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Load Sage object from the file with name filename, which will have
    an ``.sobj`` extension added if it doesn't have one.  Or, if the input
    is a filename ending in ``.py``, ``.pyx``, ``.sage``, ``.spyx``,
    ``.f``, ``.f90`` or ``.m``, load that file into the current running
    session using :func:`sage.repl.load.load`.

    Loaded files are not loaded into their own namespace, i.e., this is
    much more like Python's ``execfile`` than Python's ``import``.

    This function also loads a ``.sobj`` file over a network by
    specifying the full URL.  (Setting ``verbose = False`` suppresses
    the loading progress indicator.)

    When a pickle created with Python 2 is unpickled in Python 3, Sage
    uses the default encoding ``latin1`` to unpickle data of type :class:`str`.

    Finally, if you give multiple positional input arguments, then all
    of those files are loaded, or all of the objects are loaded and a
    list of the corresponding loaded objects is returned.

    If ``compress`` is true (the default), then the data stored in the file
    are supposed to be compressed. If ``verbose`` is true (the default), then
    some logging is printed when accessing remote files. Further keyword
    arguments are passed to :func:`pickle.load`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: u = 'https://www.sagemath.org/files/test.sobj'
        sage: s = load(u)                                                  # optional - internet

        'hello SageMath'

    We test loading a file or multiple files or even mixing loading files and objects::

        sage: t = tmp_filename(ext='.py')
        sage: with open(t, 'w') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("print('hello world')")
        sage: load(t)
        hello world
        sage: load(t,t)
        hello world
        hello world
        sage: t2 = tmp_filename(); save(2/3,t2)
        sage: load(t,t,t2)
        hello world
        hello world
        [None, None, 2/3]

    Files with a ``.sage`` extension are preparsed. Also note that we
    can access global variables::

        sage: t = tmp_filename(ext='.sage')
        sage: with open(t, 'w') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("a += Mod(2/3, 11)")  # This evaluates to Mod(8, 11)
        sage: a = -1
        sage: load(t)
        sage: a
        7

    We can load Fortran files::

        sage: code = '      subroutine hello\n         print *, "Hello World!"\n      end subroutine hello\n'
        sage: t = tmp_filename(ext='.F')

def register_unpickle_override(module, name, callable, call_name=None):
    r"""
    Python pickles include the module and class name of classes.
    This means that rearranging the Sage source can invalidate old
    pickles.  To keep the old pickles working, you can call
    register_unpickle_override with an old module name and class name,
    and the Python callable (function, class with __call__ method, etc.)
    to use for unpickling.  (If this callable is a value in some module,
    you can specify the module name and class name, for the benefit of
    :func:`~sage.misc.explain_pickle.explain_pickle` when called with ``in_current_sage=True``).)

    EXAMPLES:

    Imagine that there used to be an ``old_integer`` module and old
    pickles essentially trying to do the following::

        sage: unpickle_global('sage.rings.old_integer', 'OldInteger')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ImportError: cannot import OldInteger from sage.rings.old_integer, call register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.old_integer', 'OldInteger', ...) to fix this

    After following the advice from the error message, unpickling
    works::

        sage: from sage.misc.persist import register_unpickle_override
        sage: register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.old_integer', 'OldInteger', Integer)
        sage: unpickle_global('sage.rings.old_integer', 'OldInteger')
        <... 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>

    In many cases, unpickling problems for old pickles can be resolved with a
    simple call to ``register_unpickle_override``, as in the example above and
    in many of the ``sage`` source files.  However, if the underlying data
    structure has changed significantly then unpickling may fail and it
    will be necessary to explicitly implement unpickling methods for the
    associated objects. The python pickle protocol is described in detail on the
    web and, in particular, in the `python pickling documentation`_. For example, the
    following excerpt from this documentation shows that the unpickling of
    classes is controlled by their :meth:`__setstate__` method.

    ::

        object.__setstate__(state)

            Upon unpickling, if the class also defines the method :meth:`__setstate__`, it is
            called with the unpickled state. If there is no :meth:`__setstate__` method,
            the pickled state must be a dictionary and its items are assigned to the new
            instance's dictionary. If a class defines both :meth:`__getstate__` and
            :meth:`__setstate__`, the state object needn't be a dictionary and these methods
            can do what they want.

    .. _python pickling documentation: https://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#pickle-protocol

    By implementing a :meth:`__setstate__` method for a class it should be
    possible to fix any unpickling problems for the class. As an example of what
    needs to be done, we show how to unpickle a :class:`CombinatorialObject`
    object using a class which also inherits from
    :class:`~sage.structure.element.Element`. This exact problem often arises
    when refactoring old code into the element framework. First we create a
    pickle to play with::

        sage: from sage.structure.element import Element
        sage: class SourPickle(CombinatorialObject): pass
        sage: class SweetPickle(CombinatorialObject, Element): pass
        sage: import __main__
        sage: __main__.SourPickle = SourPickle
        sage: __main__.SweetPickle = SweetPickle  # a hack to allow us to pickle command line classes
        sage: gherkin = dumps(SourPickle([1, 2, 3]))

    Using :func:`register_unpickle_override` we try to sweeten our pickle, but
    we are unable to eat it::

        sage: from sage.misc.persist import register_unpickle_override
        sage: register_unpickle_override('__main__', 'SourPickle', SweetPickle)
        sage: loads(gherkin)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        KeyError: 0

    The problem is that the ``SweetPickle`` has inherited a
    :meth:`~sage.structure.element.Element.__setstate__` method from
    :class:`~sage.structure.element.Element` which is not compatible with
    unpickling for :class:`CombinatorialObject`. We can fix this by explicitly
    defining a new :meth:`__setstate__` method::

        sage: class SweeterPickle(CombinatorialObject, Element):
        ....:     def __setstate__(self, state):
        ....:         # a pickle from CombinatorialObject is just its instance
        ....:         # dictionary
        ....:         if isinstance(state, dict):
        ....:             # this is a fudge: we need an appropriate parent here
        ....:             self._set_parent(Tableaux())
        ....:             self.__dict__ = state
        ....:         else:
        ....:             P, D = state
        ....:             if P is not None:
        ....:                 self._set_parent(P)
        ....:             self.__dict__ = D
        sage: __main__.SweeterPickle = SweeterPickle
        sage: register_unpickle_override('__main__', 'SourPickle', SweeterPickle)
        sage: loads(gherkin)                                                            # needs sage.combinat
        [1, 2, 3]
        sage: loads(dumps(SweeterPickle([1, 2, 3])))  # check that pickles work for SweeterPickle
        [1, 2, 3]

    The ``state`` passed to :meth:`__setstate__` will usually be something like
    the instance dictionary of the pickled object, however, with some older
    classes such as :class:`CombinatorialObject` it will be a tuple. In general,
    the ``state`` can be any python object.  ``Sage`` provides a special tool,
    :func:`~sage.misc.explain_pickle.explain_pickle`, which can help in figuring
    out the contents of an old pickle. Here is a second example.

    ::

        sage: class A():
        ....:    def __init__(self, value):
        ....:        self.original_attribute = value
        ....:    def __repr__(self):
        ....:        return 'A(%s)' % self.original_attribute
        sage: class B():
        ....:    def __init__(self, value):
        ....:        self.new_attribute = value
        ....:    def __setstate__(self, state):
        ....:        try:
        ....:            self.new_attribute = state['new_attribute']
        ....:        except KeyError:      # an old pickle
        ....:            self.new_attribute = state['original_attribute']
        ....:    def __repr__(self):
        ....:        return 'B(%s)' % self.new_attribute
        sage: import __main__
        sage: # a hack to allow us to pickle command line classes
        sage: __main__.A = A
        sage: __main__.B = B
        sage: A(10)
        A(10)
        sage: loads(dumps(A(10)))
        A(10)
        sage: sage.misc.explain_pickle.explain_pickle(dumps(A(10)))
        pg_A = unpickle_global('__main__', 'A')
        si = unpickle_newobj(pg_A, ())
        pg_make_integer = unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'make_integer')
        unpickle_build(si, {'original_attribute':pg_make_integer('a')})
        si
        sage: from sage.misc.persist import register_unpickle_override
        sage: register_unpickle_override('__main__', 'A', B)
        sage: loads(dumps(A(10)))
        B(10)
        sage: loads(dumps(B(10)))
        B(10)

    Pickling for python classes and extension classes, such as cython, is
    different -- again this is discussed in the `python pickling
    documentation`_. For the unpickling of extension classes you need to write
    a :meth:`__reduce__` method which typically returns a tuple ``(f,
    args,...)`` such that ``f(*args)`` returns (a copy of) the original object.
    The following code snippet is the
    :meth:`~sage.rings.integer.Integer.__reduce__` method from
    :class:`sage.rings.integer.Integer`.

    .. code-block:: cython

        def __reduce__(self):

    Given a module name and a name within that module (typically a class
    name), retrieve the corresponding object.  This normally just looks
    up the name in the module, but it can be overridden by
    register_unpickle_override.  This is used in the Sage unpickling
    mechanism, so if the Sage source code organization changes,
    register_unpickle_override can allow old pickles to continue to work.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.misc.persist import unpickle_override, register_unpickle_override
        sage: unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer')

    Now we horribly break the pickling system::

        sage: register_unpickle_override('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer', Rational, call_name=('sage.rings.rational', 'Rational'))
        sage: unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer')
        <class 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>

    and we reach into the internals and put it back::

        sage: del unpickle_override[('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer')]
        sage: unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer')

def unpickle_all(target, debug=False, run_test_suite=False):
    """
    Unpickle all ``.sobj`` files in a directory or tar archive.

    INPUT:

    - ``target`` -- string; the name of a directory or of a (possibly
      compressed) tar archive that contains a single directory of
      ``.sobj`` files.  The tar archive can be in any format that
      python's ``tarfile`` module understands; for example,
      ``.tar.gz`` or ``.tar.bz2``.
    - ``debug`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)
      whether to report a stacktrace in case of failure
    - ``run_test_suite`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)
      whether to run ``TestSuite(x).run()`` on the unpickled objects

    OUTPUT:

    Typically, two lines are printed: the first reporting the number
    of successfully unpickled files, and the second reporting the
    number (zero) of failures. If there are failures, however, then a
    list of failed files will be printed before either of those lines,
    and the failure count will of course be nonzero.

    .. WARNING::

       You must only pass trusted data to this function, including tar
       archives. We use the "data" filter from PEP 706 if possible
       while extracting the archive, but even that is not a perfect
       solution, and it is only available since Python 3.11.4.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: dir = tmp_dir()
        sage: sage.misc.persist.picklejar('hello', dir)
        sage: sage.misc.persist.unpickle_all(dir)
        Successfully unpickled 1 objects.
        Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
