    """
    An implementation of the C3 algorithm.

    C3 is the algorithm used by Python to construct the method
    resolution order for new style classes involving multiple
    inheritance.

    After :issue:`11943` this implementation was used to compute the
    list of super categories of a category; see
    :meth:`~sage.categories.category.Category.all_super_categories`.
    The purpose is to ensure that list of super categories matches
    with the method resolution order of the parent or element classes
    of a category.

    Since :issue:`13589`, this implementation is superseded by that in
    :mod:`sage.misc.c3_controlled`, that puts the ``C3`` algorithm
    under control of some total order on categories.  This guarantees
    that ``C3`` always finds a consistent Method Resolution Order. For
    background, see :mod:`sage.misc.c3_controlled`.

    INPUT:

    - ``start`` -- an object; the returned list is built upon data
      provided by certain attributes of ``start``
    - ``bases`` -- string; the name of an attribute of ``start``
      providing a list of objects
    - ``attribute`` -- string; the name of an attribute of the
      objects provided in ``getattr(start,bases)``. That attribute is
      supposed to provide a list.

    ASSUMPTIONS:

    Our implementation of the algorithm only works on lists of
    objects that compare equal if and only if they are identical.

    OUTPUT:

    A list, the result of the C3 algorithm applied to the list
    ``[getattr(X,attribute) for X in getattr(start,bases)]``.

    EXAMPLES:

    We create a class for elements in a hierarchy that uses the ``C3``
    algorithm to compute, for each element, a linear extension of the
    elements above it::

    .. TODO:: Move back the __init__ at the beginning

        sage: from sage.misc.c3 import C3_algorithm
        sage: class HierarchyElement(UniqueRepresentation):
        ....:     @lazy_attribute
        ....:     def _all_bases(self):
        ....:         return C3_algorithm(self, '_bases', '_all_bases', False)
        ....:     def __repr__(self):
        ....:         return self._name
        ....:     def __init__(self, name, bases):
        ....:         self._name = name
        ....:         self._bases = list(bases)

    We construct a little hierarchy::

        sage: T = HierarchyElement("T", ())
        sage: X = HierarchyElement("X", (T,))
        sage: Y = HierarchyElement("Y", (T,))
        sage: A = HierarchyElement("A", (X, Y))
        sage: B = HierarchyElement("B", (Y, X))
        sage: Foo = HierarchyElement("Foo", (A, B))

    And inspect the linear extensions associated to each element::

        sage: T._all_bases
        [T]
        sage: X._all_bases
        [X, T]
        sage: Y._all_bases
        [Y, T]
        sage: A._all_bases
        [A, X, Y, T]
        sage: B._all_bases
        [B, Y, X, T]

    So far so good. However::

        sage: Foo._all_bases
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Cannot merge the items X, Y.

    The ``C3`` algorithm is not able to create a consistent linear
    extension. Indeed, its specifications impose that, if ``X`` and
    ``Y`` appear in a certain order in the linear extension for an
    element of the hierarchy, then they should appear in the same
    order for any lower element. This is clearly not possibly for
    ``Foo``, since ``A`` and ``B`` impose incompatible orders. If the
    above was a hierarchy of classes, Python would complain that it
    cannot calculate a consistent Method Resolution Order.

    TESTS:

    Regression test for bug #1 of :issue:`13501`::

        sage: class C(): pass
        sage: class F(): pass
        sage: class G(): pass
        sage: class B(C,F):    pass
        sage: class D(F,G):    pass
        sage: class E(F):      pass
        sage: class A(B,D,E):  pass
        sage: [cls.__name__ for cls in A.mro()]
        ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'object']

        sage: C = HierarchyElement("C", ())
        sage: F = HierarchyElement("F", ())
        sage: G = HierarchyElement("G", ())
        sage: B = HierarchyElement("B", (C, F))
        sage: D = HierarchyElement("D", (F, G))
        sage: E = HierarchyElement("E", (F,))
        sage: A = HierarchyElement("A", (B, D, E))
        sage: A._all_bases
        [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]

    Regression test for bug #2 of :issue:`13501`. The following should
    fail since ``A`` asks for ``B`` to come before ``C``, where as
    ``B`` is a super class of ``C``::

        sage: class B(): pass
        sage: class C(B): pass
        sage: class A(B, C): pass
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ...Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO)
        for bases ...

        sage: B = HierarchyElement("B", ())
        sage: C = HierarchyElement("C", (B,))
        sage: A = HierarchyElement("A", (B,C))
        sage: A._all_bases
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Cannot merge the items B, C, B.

    Since :issue:`11943`, the following consistency tests are part
    of the test suites of categories (except for hom categories)::

        sage: C = Category.join([HopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ), FiniteEnumeratedSets()])
        sage: C.parent_class.mro() == [x.parent_class for x in C.all_super_categories()]+[object]
        True
        sage: C.element_class.mro() == [x.element_class for x in C.all_super_categories()]+[object]
        True
