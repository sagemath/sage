        An example of two polyhedra with isomorphic face lattices
        but different incidence matrices::

        OUTPUT:

        Return a vector whose `i`-th entry is the number of
        `i-2`-dimensional faces of the polytope.

            The ``vertices`` as given by :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base0.Polyhedron_base0.vertices`
            do not need to correspond to `0`-dimensional faces. If a polyhedron
            contains `k` lines they correspond to `k`-dimensional faces.
            See example below.

            sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2],

          * ``'primal'`` -- start with the facets

        EXAMPLES::

            [1 0 1 1 1]
            [1 1 0 1 1]
            [1 1 1 0 1]
            [1 1 1 1 0]

        The rows and columns of the vertex adjacency matrix correspond
        to the :meth:`Vrepresentation` objects: vertices, rays, and
        lines. The `(i,j)` matrix entry equals `1` if the `i`-th and
        `j`-th V-representation object are adjacent.

        Two vertices are adjacent if they are the endpoints of an
        edge, that is, a one-dimensional face. For unbounded polyhedra
        this clearly needs to be generalized and we define two
        V-representation objects (see
        :mod:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor`) to be adjacent if
        they together generate a one-face. There are three possible
        combinations:

        * Two vertices can bound a finite-length edge.

        * A vertex and a ray can generate a half-infinite edge
          starting at the vertex and with the direction given by the
          ray.

        * A vertex and a line can generate an infinite edge. The
          position of the vertex on the line is arbitrary in this
          case, only its transverse position matters. The direction of
          the edge is given by the line generator.

        For example, take the half-plane::

            sage: half_plane = Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0,1,0)])
            sage: half_plane.Hrepresentation()
            (An inequality (1, 0) x + 0 >= 0,)

        Its (non-unique) V-representation consists of a vertex, a ray,
        and a line. The only edge is spanned by the vertex and the
        line generator, so they are adjacent::

            sage: half_plane.Vrepresentation()
            (A line in the direction (0, 1), A ray in the direction (1, 0), A vertex at (0, 0))
            sage: half_plane.vertex_adjacency_matrix()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 0]
            [1 0 0]

        In one dimension higher, that is for a half-space in 3
        dimensions, there is no one-dimensional face. Hence nothing is
        adjacent::

            sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0,1,0,0)]).vertex_adjacency_matrix()
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]

        EXAMPLES:

        In a bounded polygon, every vertex has precisely two adjacent ones::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:     print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (3, 0)
            (1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (4, 1)

        If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and
        one ray, then each V-representation object is adjacent to two
        V-representation objects::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)],
            ....:                rays=[(0,1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:       print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 1) A ray in the direction (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (0, 1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (3, 0)
            (1, 0, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (4, 1)

        If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and
        two distinct rays, then each vertex is adjacent to two
        V-representation objects (which can now be vertices or
        rays). The two rays are not adjacent to each other::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)],
            ....:                rays=[(0,1), (1,1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:     print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 0) A ray in the direction (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 1) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) A ray in the direction (1, 1)
            (0, 0, 1, 1, 0) A vertex at (3, 0)

            (0, 1, 3, 7)

        The indices are the indices of the
        :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base0.Polyhedron_base0.Hrepresentation`.
        ``0`` corresponds to an equation and is ignored::

            A 4-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^5 defined as the convex hull of 120 vertices

        The input is flexible::

            A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^5 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices

        The ``Hrepresentatives`` must belong to ``self``::

            A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
            sage: Q.meet_of_Hrep(f)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: not a facet of ``self``
