Sudoku Puzzles

This module provides algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles, plus tools
for inputting, converting and displaying various ways of writing a
puzzle or its solution(s).  Primarily this is accomplished with the
:class:`sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku` class, though the legacy top-level
:func:`sage.games.sudoku.sudoku` function is also available.

def sudoku(m):
    r"""
    Solve Sudoku puzzles described by matrices.

    INPUT:

    - ``m`` -- a square Sage matrix over `\ZZ`, where zeros are blank entries

    OUTPUT:

    A Sage matrix over `\ZZ` containing the first solution found,
    otherwise ``None``.

    This function matches the behavior of the prior Sudoku solver
    and is included only to replicate that behavior.  It could be
    safely deprecated, since all of its functionality is included in the :class:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku` class.

    EXAMPLES:

    An example that was used in previous doctests. ::

        sage: A = matrix(ZZ,9,[5,0,0, 0,8,0, 0,4,9, 0,0,0, 5,0,0, 0,3,0, 0,6,7, 3,0,0, 0,0,1, 1,5,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,  0,0,0, 2,0,8, 0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,1,8, 7,0,0, 0,0,4, 1,5,0, 0,3,0, 0,0,2, 0,0,0, 4,9,0, 0,5,0, 0,0,3])

class Sudoku(SageObject):
    r"""
    An object representing a Sudoku puzzle.  Primarily the purpose is to
    solve the puzzle, but conversions between formats are also provided.

    INPUT:

    - ``puzzle`` -- the first argument can take one of three forms
        * list - a Python list with elements of the puzzle in row-major order,
          where a blank entry is a zero
        * matrix - a square Sage matrix over `\ZZ`
        * string - a string where each character is an entry of
          the puzzle. For two-digit entries, a = 10, b = 11, etc.
    - ``verify_input`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); use ``False`` if you know
      the input is valid

        Return a generator object for the solutions of a Sudoku puzzle.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'dlx'``); specify choice of
          solution algorithm. The two possible algorithms are ``'dlx'`` and
          ``'backtrack'``

        OUTPUT:

        A generator that provides all solutions, as objects of
        the :class:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku` class.

        Calling ``next()`` on the returned generator just once will find
        a solution, presuming it exists, otherwise it will return a
        ``StopIteration`` exception.  The generator may be used for
        iteration or wrapping the generator with ``list()`` will return
        all of the solutions as a list.  Solutions are returned as
        new objects of the :class:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku` class,
        so may be printed or converted using other methods in this class.

        Generally, the DLX algorithm is very fast and very consistent.
        The backtrack algorithm is very variable in its performance,
        on some occasions markedly faster than DLX but usually slower
        by a similar factor, with the potential to be orders of magnitude
        slower.  See the docstrings for the
        :meth:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku.dlx` and
        :meth:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku.backtrack_all`
        methods for further discussions and examples of performance.
        Note that the backtrack algorithm is limited to puzzles of
        size `16\times 16` or smaller.

    def backtrack(self):
        r"""
        Return a generator which iterates through all solutions of a Sudoku puzzle.

        This function is intended to be called from the
        :func:`~sage.games.sudoku.Sudoku.solve` method
        when the ``algorithm='backtrack'`` option is specified.
        However it may be called directly as a method of an
        instance of a Sudoku puzzle.

        At this point, this method calls
        :func:`~sage.games.sudoku_backtrack.backtrack_all` which
        constructs *all* of the solutions as a list.  Then the
        present method just returns the items of the list one at
        a time.  Once Cython supports closures and a yield statement
        is supported, then the contents of ``backtrack_all()``
        may be subsumed into this method and the
        :mod:`sage.games.sudoku_backtrack` module can be removed.

        This routine can have wildly variable performance, with a
        factor of 4000 observed between the fastest and slowest
        `9\times 9` examples tested. Examples designed to perform
        poorly for naive backtracking, will do poorly
        (such as ``d`` below).  However, examples meant to be
        difficult for humans often do very well, with a factor
        of 5 improvement over the `DLX` algorithm.

        Without dynamically allocating arrays in the Cython version,
        we have limited this function to `16\times 16` puzzles.
        Algorithmic details are in the
        :mod:`sage.games.sudoku_backtrack` module.

        EXAMPLES:

        This example was reported to be very difficult for human solvers.
        This algorithm works very fast on it, at about half the time
        of the DLX solver. [sudoku:escargot]_ ::

        with ``verify_input=False`` is the fastest way to

        Or if only one solution is needed it can be obtained with
        one call to ``next()``, while the existence of a solution

        ALGORITHM:

        The ``DLXCPP`` solver finds solutions to the exact-cover
        problem with a "Dancing Links" backtracking algorithm.
        Given a `0-1` matrix, the solver finds a subset of the
        rows that sums to the all `1`'s vector.  The columns
        correspond to conditions, or constraints, that must be
        met by a solution, while the rows correspond to some
        collection of choices, or decisions.  A `1` in a row
        and column indicates that the choice corresponding to
        the row meets the condition corresponding to the column.

        So here, we code the notion of a Sudoku puzzle, and the
        hints already present, into such a `0-1` matrix.  Then the
        :class:`sage.combinat.matrices.dlxcpp.DLXCPP` solver makes
        the choices for the blank entries.

        rcbox = [ [i//n + n*(j//n) for i in range(nsquare)] for j in range(nsquare)]

        # Every entry in a Sudoku puzzle satisfies four constraints
        # Every location has a single entry, and each row, column and box has each symbol once
        # These arrays can be thought of as assigning ID numbers to these constraints,
        # and correspond to column numbers of the `0-1` matrix describing the exact cover

            Construct a row of the `0-1` matrix describing
            the exact cover constraints for a Sudoku puzzle.

            If a (zero-based) ``entry`` is placed in location
            ``(row, col)`` of a Sudoku puzzle, then exactly four
            constraints are satisfied: the location has this entry,
            and the entry occurs in the row, column and box.
            This method looks up the constraint IDs for each of
            these four constraints, and returns a list of these four IDs.
