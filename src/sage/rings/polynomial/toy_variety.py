Educational versions of Groebner basis algorithms: triangular factorization

In this file is the implementation of two algorithms in [Laz1992]_.

The main algorithm is ``Triangular``; a secondary algorithm, necessary for the
first, is ``ElimPolMin``. As per Lazard's formulation, the implementation works
with any term ordering, not only lexicographic.

Lazard does not specify a few of the subalgorithms implemented as the
functions

* ``is_triangular``,
* ``is_linearly_dependent``, and
* ``linear_representation``.

The implementations are not hard, and the choice of algorithm is described
with the relevant function.

No attempt was made to optimize these algorithms as the emphasis of this
implementation is a clean and easy presentation.

Examples appear with the appropriate function.

    The algorithm is based on the definition of a triangular basis,
    given by Lazard in 1992 in [Laz1992]_.

def is_linearly_dependent(polys) -> bool:
    """
    Decide whether the polynomials of ``polys`` are linearly dependent.

    Here ``polys`` is a collection of polynomials.

    The algorithm creates a matrix of coefficients of the monomials of
    ``polys``. It computes the echelon form of the matrix, then checks whether
    any of the rows is the zero vector.

    Essentially this relies on the fact that the monomials are linearly
    independent, and therefore is building a linear map from the vector space of
    the monomials to the canonical basis of ``R^n``, where ``n`` is the number of
    distinct monomials in ``polys``. There is a zero vector iff there is a
    linear dependence among ``polys``.

    The case where ``polys=[]`` is considered to be not linearly dependent.

    If ``p`` is not in fact a linear combination of ``polys``,
    the function raises an exception.

    The algorithm creates a matrix of coefficients of the monomials of
    ``polys`` and ``p``, with the coefficients of ``p`` in the last
    row. It augments this matrix with the appropriate identity matrix, then
    computes the echelon form of the augmented matrix. The last row should
    contain zeroes in the first columns, and the last

    the desired linear relation is straightforward.
