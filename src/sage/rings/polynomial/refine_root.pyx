    We are given a polynomial and its derivative (with complex
    interval coefficients), an estimated root, and a complex interval
    field to use in computations.  We use interval arithmetic to
    refine the root and prove that we have in fact isolated a unique
    root.

    If we succeed, we return the isolated root; if we fail, we return
    None.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: # needs sage.symbolic
        sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.refine_root import refine_root
        sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
        sage: p = x^9 - 1
        sage: ip = CIF['x'](p); ip
        x^9 - 1
        sage: ipd = CIF['x'](p.derivative()); ipd
        9*x^8
        sage: irt = CIF(CC(cos(2*pi/9), sin(2*pi/9))); irt

    # There has got to be a better way to do this, but I don't know
    # what it is...

    # We start with a basic fact: if we do an interval Newton-Raphson
    # step, and the refined interval is contained in the original interval,
    # then the refined interval contains exactly one root.

    # Unfortunately, our initial estimated root almost certainly does not
    # contain the actual root (our initial interval is a point, which
    # is exactly equal to whatever floating-point estimate we got from
    # the external solver).  So we need to do multiple Newton-Raphson
    # steps, and check this inclusion property on each step.

    # After a few steps of refinement, if the initial root estimate was
    # close to a root, we should have an essentially perfect interval
    # bound on the root (since Newton-Raphson has quadratic convergence),
    # unless either the real or imaginary component of the root is zero.
    # If the real or imaginary component is zero, then we could spend
    # a long time computing closer and closer approximations to that
    # component.  (This doesn't happen for nonzero components, because
    # of the imprecision of floating-point numbers combined with the
    # outward interval rounding; but close to zero, MPFI provides
    # extremely precise numbers.)

    # If the root is actually a real root, but we start with an imaginary
    # component, we can bounce back and forth between having a positive
    # and negative imaginary component, without ever hitting zero.
    # To deal with this, on every other Newton-Raphson step, instead of
    # replacing the old interval with the new one, we take the union.

    # If the containment check continues to fail many times in a row,
    # we give up and return None; we also return None if we detect
    # that the slope in our current interval is not bounded away
    # from zero at any step.

    # After every refinement step, we check to see if the real or
    # imaginary component of our interval includes zero.  If so, we
    # try setting it to exactly zero.  This gives us a good chance of
    # detecting real roots.  However, we do this replacement at most
    # once per component.
