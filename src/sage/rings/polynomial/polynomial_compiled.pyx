        Compiles a polynomial into an evaluation DAG representation which
        is at least as optimal as using Horner's Rule.  For polynomials
        which have a relatively large number of zero coefficients, the
        improvement over Horner's Rule grows significantly.

        Here is a rough description of the algorithm.  Actual
        implementation differs slightly, for sake of speed.  Specifically,
        steps 1 and 3 are done at the same time.

        Step 1: Collect Coefficient Gaps.
                Scan through coefficient list, and record the lengths of
                sequences of zero coefficients.  This corresponds to
                collapsing Horner's Form into a reduced representation.
                For example, ::

                  x^8 + x^4 + x^2 + 1
                   = ((((((((1)*x + 0)*x+0)*x+0)*x+1)*x+0)*x+0)*x+1)*x+0)*x+1
                   = ((((1)*x^4 + 1)*x^2 + 1)*x^2 + 1

                gives a list of "gaps": [2,4]

        Step 2: Fill in Gap Structure.
                Given the list of gaps, find a reasonable sequence of
                of multiplications / squarings of x that will result in
                the computation of all desired exponents.  Record this
                sequence of steps as an evaluation DAG, and retain
                references to the nodes representing the desired
                exponents.  For the example above, we would have::

                  x^2 = x*x
                  x^4 = (x^2) * (x^2)

        Step 3: Construct Evaluation Dag.
                Rescan the coefficient list, and build an evaluation DAG
                representation for the reduced Horner Form as above.
                Whenever a sequence of zeros is encountered, multiply by
                the appropriate "gap" node.  Retain a reference to the
                result node.

        Implementation considerations:

        * By combining steps 1 and 3, we greatly improve the speed of
          this construction, but some complexity is introduced.  The
          solution to this is that "dummy" nodes are created to represent
          the desired gaps.  As the structure of the gaps is filled in,
          these dummies get references to usable DAG nodes.  After all gaps
          are filled in, we strip out dummy nodes, and are left with a
          complete representation of our polynomial.

        * The "binary" algorithm (currently the only algorithm; others are
          forthcoming) requires the gaps to considered in order, and adds
          additional dummies as it goes.  Hence, the gaps are put into a
          binary tree.

        The desired gaps come in a tree, filled with dummy nodes (with the

        labeled with their width.  When we refer to multiplication or
        squaring nodes, we give the current dummy node a usable dag of the
        appropriate type, which treats the nodes being operated on as
        argument.  That is, if we want to multiply nodes A and B, and
        give the result to M, we would call ::

            M.fill(mul_pd(A,B))

        and refer to this operation as ::

            M = A*B

        Sometimes we want a node that isn't in the tree.  In that case, we
        create a new dummy node, and put it into the tree.  The phrase
        "get the node for..." means that we obtain one with the _get_gap
        method, which may create a new node.


        Fill in the gaps with the following algorithm:

        | Step 1:
        |     Remove max node from the tree, denote its width m.
        |     If m == 1, halt.
        |
        | Step 2:
        |     If m is even, check if m/2 is already in our tree.
        |     If yes, square the node corresponding to m/2, and go to step 1.
        |
        | Step 3:
        |     Peek at the next-largest, and denote its width n.
        |     Write m = qn+r.
        |     If r != 0, get the node R, whose gap-width is r.
        |         Also, get the node QN, whose width is qn.
        |         Then, set M = R*QN and go to step 1.
        |     If r == 0, we have two cases:
        |         q is even:
        |             get/create the node for q/n, denote it T.
        |             Set M = T**2 and go to step 1.
        |         q is odd:
        |             get/create the node for (Q-1)*N, denote it T.
        |             Set M = T*N and go to step 1.

#
#  Polynomial DAG Code
#
# An "evaluation DAG" is a rather generic concept.  What
# follows is a set of DAG classes which are suitable for
# evaluating polynomials in Horner's form, and very
# little else.  Let's call them polydags from here down.
# DAG in all-caps is a whole graph. However,
# polydag or pd := polynomial DAG node
#
# 5 operations, and 3 types of constants are implemented:
#
#  univar_pd: a variable of a univariate polynomial.
#  var_pd: a variable of a multivariate polynomial.
#          parametrized by an index number.
#  const_pd: a coefficient of a polynomial.  Also
#            parametrized by an index number.
#
# unary operations:
#
#  sqr_pd: takes another polydag as an argument, squares
#          by multiplying argument's value by itself.
#  pow_pd: takes another polydag, and an int, as arguments.
#          exponentiates with the ** operator.
#
# binary operations:
#
#  add_pd: adds values of two other polydags.
#  mul_pd: like add_pd, but we with multiplication
#  abc_pd: not technically binary, but it only depends
#          upon two other polydags, so it fits into the
#          class structure this way.  Multiplies the
#          values of two other polydags, and adds the
#          coefficient corresponding to the given index.
#
# Polydag structure:
#  properties:
#    value: some python object.  Should be None before
#           and after the DAG is evaluated.
#    refs: number of polydag nodes that reference self
#    hits: number of times, during current computation,
#          that self.value has been accessed
#    label: used to identify nodes from the outside.
#           specifically, when they're in a binary tree.
#
#  methods:
#    eval: runs the computation for which the node is
#          intended, and stores the result in self.value.
#          Takes 2 python objects as arguments.  The first
#          is the value of the variable, for univariate
#          polynomials, or a tuple of values for multi-
#          variate.  The second is the list of coefficients.
#          The reason for taking the list of coefficients,
#          rather than holding references to them, is that
#          we can implement recursive calling at some later
#          date.
#    nodummies: recursively evict dummies, replacing them
#               with the non-dummy nodes that they
#               reference.


# These inline functions are called wherever a node gets
# evaluated.  First, pd_eval is called to ensure that the
# target DAG node will have its .value property set. It
# serves two purposes:
#   1) Count the number of times this node has been asked
#      for its value.
#   2) Call the node's eval() function if and only if it
#      has not been called yet.  These functions are
#      inlined to prevent excessive function calls.
# Then, pd_clean is called.  It checks to see if all of
# the polydag's dependents have phoned in, and resets
# self.value to None if they have.  Thus, we don't hold
# on to intermediate values any longer than we have to.
