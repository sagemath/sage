Discrete valuations

This file defines abstract base classes for discrete (pseudo-)valuations.

EXAMPLES:

Discrete valuations can be created on a variety of rings::

    sage: ZZ.valuation(2)
    2-adic valuation
    sage: GaussianIntegers().valuation(3)                                               # needs sage.rings.number_field
    3-adic valuation
    sage: QQ.valuation(5)
    5-adic valuation
    sage: Zp(7).valuation()
    7-adic valuation

::

    sage: # needs sage.rings.function_field
    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: K.valuation(x)
    (x)-adic valuation
    sage: K.valuation(x^2 + 1)
    (x^2 + 1)-adic valuation
    sage: K.valuation(1/x)
    Valuation at the infinite place

::

    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: w = GaussValuation(R, v)
    sage: w.augmentation(x, 3)
    [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x) = 3 ]

We can also define discrete pseudo-valuations, i.e., discrete valuations that
send more than just zero to infinity::

    sage: w.augmentation(x, infinity)
    [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x) = +Infinity ]

        We redirect to :meth:`_hash_`, so that subclasses can only override
        :meth:`_hash_` and :meth:`_eq_` if they want to provide a different
        notion of equality but they can leave the partial and total operators
        untouched.

        EXAMPLES::

        We override the strange default provided by

        Note that the vast majority of valuations come out of a
        :class:`sage.structure.factory.UniqueFactory` and therefore override
        our implementation of :meth:`__hash__` and :meth:`__eq__`.

        We redirect to methods :meth:`_eq_`, :meth:`_lt_`, and :meth:`_gt_` to
        make it easier for subclasses to override only parts of this
        functionality.

        Note that valuations usually implement ``x == y`` as ``x`` and ``y``
        are indistinguishable. Whereas ``x <= y`` and ``x >= y`` are
        implemented with respect to the natural partial order of valuations.
        As a result, ``x <= y and x >= y`` does not imply ``x == y``.

        Return approximants on `K[x]` for the extensions of this valuation to

        If `G` is an irreducible polynomial, then this corresponds to
        extensions of this valuation to the completion of `L`.

        INPUT:

        - ``G`` -- a monic squarefree integral polynomial in a
          univariate polynomial ring over the domain of this valuation

        - ``assume_squarefree`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          assume that ``G`` is squarefree. If ``True``, the squafreeness of
          ``G`` is not verified though it is necessary when
          ``require_final_EF`` is set for the algorithm to terminate.

        - ``require_final_EF`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to
          require the returned key polynomials to be in one-to-one
          correspondence to the extensions of this valuation to ``L`` and
          require them to have the ramification index and residue degree of the
          valuations they correspond to.

        - ``required_precision`` -- a number or infinity (default: -1); whether
          to require the last key polynomial of the returned valuations to have
          at least that valuation.

        - ``require_incomparability`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);
          whether to require the returned valuations to be incomparable
          (with respect to the partial order on valuations defined by comparing
          them pointwise.)

        - ``require_maximal_degree`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether
          to require the last key polynomial of the returned valuation to have
          maximal degree. This is most relevant when using this algorithm to
          compute approximate factorizations of ``G``, when set to ``True``,
          the last key polynomial has the same degree as the corresponding
          factor.

        - ``algorithm`` -- one of ``'serial'`` or ``'parallel'`` (default:
          ``'serial'``); whether or not to parallelize the algorithm

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(x^2 + 1)                                      # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron

            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x^2 + x + 1) = +Infinity ]]

        Note that ``G`` does not need to be irreducible. Here, we detect a
        factor `x + 1` and an approximate factor `x + 1` (which is an
        approximation to `x - 1`)::

            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(x^2 - 1)                                      # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron sage.rings.padics

        The factorization of primes in the Gaussian integers can be read off

            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 3-adic valuation, v(x^2 + 1) = +Infinity ]]

            sage: v0 = QQ.valuation(5)
            sage: v0.mac_lane_approximants(G)                                           # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron sage.rings.padics

             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(x - 3116/237) = 10 ]]

        The same example over the 5-adic numbers. In the quadratic extension
        `\QQ[x]/(x^2+1)`, 5 factors `-(x - 2)(x + 2)`, this behaviour can be
        read off the Mac Lane approximants::

            sage: # needs sage.rings.padics
            sage: k = Qp(5,4)
            sage: v = k.valuation()
            sage: R.<x> = k[]                                                           # needs sage.libs.ntl
            sage: G = x^2 + 1
            sage: v1,v2 = v.mac_lane_approximants(G); v1,v2                             # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron
            ([ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 2 + O(5^4)) = 1 ],
             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 3 + O(5^4)) = 1 ])
            sage: w1, w2 = v.mac_lane_approximants(G, required_precision=2); w1, w2     # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron
            ([ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 2 + 5 + O(5^4)) = 2 ],
             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 3 + 3*5 + O(5^4)) = 2 ])

        Note how the latter give a better approximation to the factors of `x^2 + 1`::

            sage: # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron sage.rings.padics
            sage: v1.phi() * v2.phi() - G
            O(5^4)*x^2 + (5 + O(5^4))*x + 5 + O(5^4)
            sage: w1.phi() * w2.phi() - G
            O(5^4)*x^2 + (5^2 + O(5^4))*x + 5^3 + O(5^4)

        In this example, the process stops with a factorization of `x^2 + 1`::

            sage: # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron sage.rings.padics
            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(G, required_precision=infinity)
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 2 + 5 + 2*5^2 + 5^3 + O(5^4)) = +Infinity ],
             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation,
               v((1 + O(5^4))*x + 3 + 3*5 + 2*5^2 + 3*5^3 + O(5^4)) = +Infinity ]]

        This obviously cannot happen over the rationals where we only get an
        approximate factorization::

            sage: v = QQ.valuation(5)
            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: G = x^2 + 1
            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(G)                                            # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(x + 2) = 1 ],
             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(x + 3) = 1 ]]
            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(G, required_precision=5)                      # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(x + 79/3) = 5 ],
             [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(x - 79/3) = 5 ]]

        Initial versions ran into problems with the trivial residue field
        extensions in this case::

            sage: # needs sage.libs.ntl
            sage: K = Qp(3, 20, print_mode='digits')
            sage: R.<T> = K[]
            sage: alpha = T^3/4
            sage: G = 3^3*T^3*(alpha^4 - alpha)^2 - (4*alpha^3 - 1)^3
            sage: G = G/G.leading_coefficient()
            sage: K.valuation().mac_lane_approximants(G)                                # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 3-adic valuation, v(...1*T + ...2) = 1/9,
               v(...1*T^9 + ...20*T^8 + ...210*T^7 + ...20*T^6 + ...20*T^5 + ...10*T^4
                  + ...220*T^3 + ...20*T^2 + ...110*T + ...122) = 55/27 ]]

        A similar example::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: v = QQ.valuation(3)
            sage: G = (x^3 + 3)^3 - 81
            sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(G)                                            # needs sage.geometry.polyhedron sage.rings.padics
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 3-adic valuation,
               v(x) = 1/3, v(x^3 + 3*x + 3) = 13/9 ]]

        Another problematic case::

            sage: K.is_galois()
            True
            sage: vK = QQ.valuation(2).extension(K)
            sage: vK(2)

            sage: vK(theta)
            1/3
            sage: G = Delta.change_ring(K)
            sage: vK.mac_lane_approximants(G)
            [[ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation,
