Valuations which are defined as limits of valuations.

The discrete valuation of a complete field extends uniquely to a finite field
extension. This is not the case anymore for fields which are not complete with
respect to their discrete valuation. In this case, the extensions essentially
correspond to the factors of the defining polynomial of the extension over the
completion. However, these factors only exist over the completion and this
makes it difficult to write down such valuations with a representation of
finite length.

More specifically, let `v` be a discrete valuation on `K` and let `L=K[x]/(G)`
a finite extension thereof. An extension of `v` to `L` can be represented as a
discrete pseudo-valuation `w'` on `K[x]` which sends `G` to infinity.
However, such `w'` might not be described by an :mod:`augmented valuation <sage.rings.valuation.augmented_valuation>`
over a :mod:`Gauss valuation <sage.rings.valuation.gauss_valuation>` anymore. Instead, we may need to write is as a
limit of augmented valuations.

The classes in this module provide the means of writing down such limits and
resulting valuations on quotients.

EXAMPLES:

In this function field, the unique place of ``K`` which corresponds to the zero
point has two extensions to ``L``. The valuations corresponding to these
extensions can only be approximated::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: R.<y> = K[]
    sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
    sage: v = K.valuation(1)
    sage: w = v.extensions(L); w
    [[ (x - 1)-adic valuation, v(y + 1) = 1 ]-adic valuation,
     [ (x - 1)-adic valuation, v(y - 1) = 1 ]-adic valuation]

The same phenomenon can be observed for valuations on number fields::

    sage: K = QQ
    sage: R.<t> = K[]
    sage: L.<t> = K.extension(t^2 + 1)
    sage: v = QQ.valuation(5)
    sage: w = v.extensions(L); w
    [[ 5-adic valuation, v(t + 2) = 1 ]-adic valuation,
     [ 5-adic valuation, v(t + 3) = 1 ]-adic valuation]

.. NOTE::

    We often rely on approximations of valuations even if we could represent the
    valuation without using a limit. This is done to improve performance as many
    computations already can be done correctly with an approximation::

        sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
        sage: R.<y> = K[]
        sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
        sage: v = K.valuation(1/x)
        sage: w = v.extension(L); w

Canonical representatives
-------------------------

A limit valuation has many finite descriptions: one may multiply its defining
polynomial by a unit, add factors that have finite value, or replace a Mac Lane
approximant by a later valuation on the same branch.  The checked
:class:`LimitValuationFactory` removes these choices before using its arguments
as a factory key.

More precisely, write the monic squarefree defining polynomial as
`G=\prod_i P_i`, with the `P_i` irreducible.  A factor which is an
equivalence-unit for the input approximation stays an equivalence-unit along
the selected branch and therefore has finite limit value.  Such factors cannot
generate the support of the limit valuation and are discarded.  There must be
exactly one remaining factor `P`; otherwise the input does not determine a
unique limit valuation.  This factor must be integral for the coefficient
valuation so that the Mac Lane algorithm applies.  The stability and
finite-refinement properties used here are recalled below with references to
[Mac1936II]_.

The extensions associated with `P` are represented by
:meth:`Mac Lane approximants
<sage.rings.valuation.valuation.DiscreteValuation.mac_lane_approximants>`.
Requiring these approximants to be incomparable separates the distinct
extensions.  The unique approximant comparable with the input valuation is
then selected by
:meth:`~sage.rings.valuation.valuation.DiscreteValuation.mac_lane_approximant`.
Thus the canonical factory key is the pair consisting of this approximant and
`P`.  This is the same normalization used for valuations on number fields and
function fields.  Inputs for which the factor or the branch is not unique are
rejected rather than assigned an arbitrary key.

Unchecked internal constructions may retain a squarefree product in place of
`P`, with the invariant that exactly one of its irreducible factors has
infinite limit value.  To evaluate a polynomial `f`, put `s=\gcd(G,f)` and
`t=G/s`.  Squarefreeness makes `s` and `t` coprime, so exactly one contains the
support factor.  The other becomes an equivalence-unit after finitely many Mac
Lane steps by Theorem 5.1 of [Mac1936II]_.  Refinement therefore terminates and
shrinks `G` towards its support.

Finally, two limit valuations extending the same coefficient valuation but
having different supports or different Mac Lane branches are incomparable.
For legacy product representations, evaluating each defining polynomial under
the other valuation first exposes the support factors.  If the supports agree,
the incomparable Mac Lane approximants distinguish the branches: comparable
initial approximants describe the same branch, while incomparable ones
describe distinct extensions.  This gives the comparison criterion used in
this module.

class LimitValuationFactory(UniqueFactory):
    r"""
    Return a limit valuation which sends the polynomial ``G`` to infinity and
    is greater than or equal than ``base_valuation``.

    INPUT:

    - ``base_valuation`` -- a discrete (pseudo-)valuation on an exact
      polynomial ring which is a discrete valuation on the coefficient ring
      and which can be uniquely augmented (possibly only in the limit) to a
      pseudo-valuation that sends ``G`` to infinity

    - ``G`` -- a nonzero nonconstant squarefree polynomial in the domain of
      ``base_valuation`` whose leading coefficient is a unit; after making it
      monic, the factor selected by ``base_valuation`` must be integral for the
      valuation on the coefficient ring

    - ``check`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to validate and
      canonicalize the arguments; internal callers may set this to ``False``
      when ``G`` is monic, squarefree, and integral and ``base_valuation``
      singles out a unique branch towards ``G``; unchecked calls use their
      arguments as the factory key and therefore do not canonicalize
      equivalent descriptions

    def create_key(self, base_valuation, G, check=True):
        r"""
        Create a key from the parameters of this valuation.

        ALGORITHM:

        First, normalize ``G`` to a monic polynomial and factor it exactly.
        Factors that are equivalence-units for ``base_valuation`` have finite
        value on every continuation of the selected branch, so they cannot be
        the support of the limit valuation.  Require exactly one remaining
        irreducible factor.

        Next, compute mutually incomparable Mac Lane approximants for that
        factor.  They distinguish the extensions of the coefficient
        valuation.  The unique approximant comparable with
        ``base_valuation`` is its canonical representative, so it and the
        irreducible factor form a factory key independent of the original
        presentation.  See the module-level discussion of canonical
        representatives for the mathematical justification.

        EXAMPLES:

        Equivalent descriptions of the same limit give the same key::

    A limit valuation that is a pseudo-valuation on polynomial ring `K[x]`

    augmentation that sends `G` to infinity and whose uniformizer must be a
    uniformizer of the limit and whose residue field must contain the residue
    field of the limit.

        ALGORITHM:

            Write `L=K[x]/(G)` and consider `g` a representative of the class
            of ``f`` in `K[x]` (of minimal degree.) Write `v` for
            ``self._approximation`` and `\phi` for the last key polynomial of
            `v`. With repeated quotient and remainder `g` has a unique
            expansion as `g=\sum a_i\phi^i`.  Suppose that `g` is an
            equivalence-unit with respect to ``self._approximation``, i.e.,
            `v(a_0) < v(a_i\phi^i)` for all `i\ne 0`. If we denote the limit
            valuation as `w`, then `v(a_i\phi^i)=w(a_i\phi^i)` since the
            valuation of key polynomials does not change during augmentations
            (Theorem 6.4 in [Mac1936II]_.) By the strict triangle inequality,
            `w(g)=v(g)`.
            Normally, the factory normalizes `G` to an irreducible polynomial.
            The unchecked internal construction also accepts a squarefree
            `G`; its invariant is that exactly one irreducible factor of the
            current `G` has infinite limit value.  Put `s=\gcd(G,f)` and
            `t=G/s`.  Since `G` is squarefree, `s` and `t` are coprime, and
            exactly one of them can contain that support factor.  The other
            one has finite value and becomes an equivalence-unit after
            finitely many Mac Lane steps (Theorem 5.1 in [Mac1936II]_).  The
            loop below therefore terminates and replaces `G` by the side that
            contains its support.  If that side divides `f`, the limit value
            of `f` is infinite; otherwise the remaining finite factor is
            removed and the argument is repeated.

        Return whether this valuation is greater or equal than ``other``
        everywhere.

        ALGORITHM:

        Distinct extensions of the same coefficient valuation are
        incomparable.  Their supports first distinguish extensions attached
        to coprime irreducible factors.  For unchecked or legacy objects,
        ``_G`` may still be a squarefree product; evaluating each object on
        the other's ``_G`` invokes
        :meth:`_improve_approximation_for_call` and refines both products to
        their support factors.  Different supports give incomparable limit
        valuations.

        Once the supports agree, mutually incomparable canonical Mac Lane
        approximants distinguish the branches above that support.  Hence the
        two limit valuations agree precisely when their initial approximants
        are comparable.  Thus this method can return ``True`` only when the
        valuations agree, although the operation being implemented is the
        pointwise order.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: F = (x^2 + 7) * (x^2 + 9)

            sage: V = QQ.valuation(2).mac_lane_approximants(F, require_incomparability=True)
            sage: valuations.LimitValuation(V[0], F) >= valuations.LimitValuation(V[1], F)
            False
