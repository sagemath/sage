            The method :meth:`_make_weak_references`, that is used for the maps
            found by the coercion system, needs to remove the usual strong
            reference from the coercion map to the homset containing it. As long
            as the user keeps strong references to domain and codomain of the map,
            we will be able to reconstruct the homset. However, a strong reference
            to the coercion map does not prevent the domain from garbage collection!

        EXAMPLES::

               to Complex Double Field

        We now demonstrate that the reference to the coercion map `\phi` does
        not prevent `Q` from being garbage collected::

            sage: import gc
            sage: del Q                                                                 # needs sage.rings.number_field

            ValueError: This map is in an invalid state,

        Apply this map to ``x``.

        IMPLEMENTATION:

        - To implement the call method in a subclass of Map, implement
          :meth:`_call_` and possibly also :meth:`_call_with_args` and
          :meth:`pushforward`.
        - If the parent of ``x`` cannot be coerced into the domain of
          ``self``, then the method ``pushforward`` is called with ``x``
          and the other given arguments, provided it is implemented.
          In that way, ``self`` could be applied to objects like ideals
          or sub-modules.
        - If there is no coercion and if ``pushforward`` is not implemented
          or fails, ``_call_`` is  called after conversion into the domain
          (which may be possible even when there is no coercion); if there
          are additional arguments (or keyword arguments),
          :meth:`_call_with_args` is called instead. Note that the
          positional arguments after ``x`` are passed as a tuple to
          :meth:`_call_with_args` and the named arguments are passed
          as a dictionary.

        INPUT:

        - ``x`` -- an element coercible to the domain of ``self``; also objects
          like ideals are supported in some cases

        OUTPUT:

        an element (or ideal, etc.)

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: phi(y)          # indirect doctest
            x

        We take the image of an ideal::

            sage: I = ideal(x, y); I
            Ideal (x, y) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
            sage: phi(I)
            Ideal (y, x) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field

        TESTS:

        We test that the map can be applied to something that converts
        (but not coerces) into the domain and can *not* be dealt with
        by :meth:`pushforward` (see :issue:`10496`)::

            sage: D = {(0, 2): -1, (0, 0): -1, (1, 1): 7, (2, 0): 1/3}
            sage: phi(D)
            -x^2 + 7*x*y + 1/3*y^2 - 1

        We test what happens if the argument can't be converted into
        the domain::

            sage: from sage.categories.map import Map
            sage: f = Map(Hom(ZZ, QQ, Rings()))

            TypeError: 1/2 fails to convert into the map's domain Integer Ring,
            but a `pushforward` method is not properly implemented

        We test that the default call method really works as described
        above (that was fixed in :issue:`10496`)::

            sage: f(1/2, exponent=2)
            pushforward Rational Field
            4

        If the argument does not coerce into the domain, and if
        ``pushforward`` fails, ``_call_`` is tried after conversion::

            sage: g = FOO(QQ, ZZ)
            sage: g(SR(3))                                                              # needs sage.symbolic

            pushforward Symbolic Ring

        If ``right`` is a ring homomorphism given by the images of
        generators, then it is attempted to form the composition
        accordingly. Only if this fails, or if the result does not
        belong to the given homset, a formal composite map is
        returned (as above).
