class TensorProductFunctor(CovariantFunctorialConstruction):
    """
    A singleton class for the tensor functor.

    This functor takes a collection of vector spaces (or modules with
    basis), and constructs the tensor product of those vector spaces.
    If this vector space is in a subcategory, say that of
    ``Algebras(QQ)``, it is automatically endowed with its natural
    algebra structure, thanks to the category
    ``Algebras(QQ).TensorProducts()`` of tensor products of algebras.
    For elements, it constructs the natural tensor product element in the
    corresponding tensor product of their parents.

    The tensor functor is covariant: if ``A`` is a subcategory of ``B``, then
    ``A.TensorProducts()`` is a subcategory of ``B.TensorProducts()`` (see
    also
    :class:`~sage.categories.covariant_functorial_construction.CovariantFunctorialConstruction`). Hence,
    the role of ``Algebras(QQ).TensorProducts()`` is solely to provide
    mathematical information and algorithms which are relevant to tensor
    product of algebras.

    Those are implemented in the nested class
    :class:`~sage.categories.algebras.Algebras.TensorProducts`
    of ``Algebras(QQ)``. This nested class is itself a subclass of
    :class:`~sage.categories.tensor.TensorProductsCategory`.
