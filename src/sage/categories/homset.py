Homsets

The class :class:`Hom` is the base class used to represent sets of morphisms
between objects of a given category.
:class:`Hom` objects are usually "weakly" cached upon creation so that they
don't have to be generated over and over but can be garbage collected together
with the corresponding objects when these are not strongly ref'ed anymore.

EXAMPLES:

In the following, the :class:`Hom` object is indeed cached::

    sage: K = GF(17)
    sage: H = Hom(ZZ, K)
    sage: H
    Set of Homomorphisms from Integer Ring to Finite Field of size 17
    sage: H is Hom(ZZ, K)
    True

Nonetheless, garbage collection occurs when the original references are
overwritten::

    sage: # needs sage.libs.pari
    sage: for p in prime_range(200):
    ....:     K = GF(p)
    ....:     H = Hom(ZZ, K)
    sage: import gc
    sage: _ = gc.collect()
    sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF
    sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
    sage: len(L)
    1
    sage: L
    [Finite Field of size 199]

        Set of Morphisms

           to Alternating group of order 3!/2 as a permutation group
           in Category of finite enumerated permutation groups
        sage: Hom(ZZ, QQ, Sets())

        Set of Morphisms
         from Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
           to Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
           in Category of commutative additive groups

    Here, we test against a memory leak that has been fixed at :issue:`11521` by
    using a weak cache::

        sage: # needs sage.libs.pari
        sage: for p in prime_range(10^3):
        ....:  K = GF(p)
        ....:  a = K(0)
        sage: import gc
        sage: gc.collect()       # random
        624
        sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF
        sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
        sage: len(L), L[0]
        (1, Finite Field of size 997)

    To illustrate the choice of the category, we consider the
    following parents as running examples::

        sage: X = ZZ; X
        Integer Ring
        sage: Y = SymmetricGroup(3); Y                                                  # needs sage.groups
        Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group

    By default, the smallest category containing both ``X`` and ``Y``,
    is used::

        sage: Hom(X, Y)                                                                 # needs sage.groups
        Set of Morphisms from Integer Ring
         to Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group
         in Category of enumerated monoids

    Otherwise, if ``category`` is specified, then ``category`` is used,
    after checking that ``X`` and ``Y`` are indeed in ``category``::

        sage: Hom(X, Y, Magmas())                                                       # needs sage.groups
        Set of Morphisms
         from Integer Ring
         to Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group
         in Category of magmas

        sage: Hom(X, Y, Groups())                                                       # needs sage.groups
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Integer Ring is not in Category of groups

    A parent (or a parent class of a category) may specify how to
    construct certain homsets by implementing a method ``_Hom_(self,
    codomain, category)``. This method should either construct the
    requested homset or raise a :exc:`TypeError`. This hook is currently
    mostly used to create homsets in some specific subclass of
    :class:`Homset` (e.g. :class:`sage.rings.homset.RingHomset`)::

        sage: Hom(QQ,QQ).__class__
        <class 'sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic_with_category'>

    Do not call this hook directly to create homsets, as it does not
    handle unique representation::

        sage: Hom(QQ,QQ) == QQ._Hom_(QQ, category=QQ.category())
        True
        sage: Hom(QQ,QQ) is QQ._Hom_(QQ, category=QQ.category())
        False

    TESTS:

    Homset are unique parents::

        sage: k = GF(5)
        sage: H1 = Hom(k, k)
        sage: H2 = Hom(k, k)
        sage: H1 is H2
        True

    Moreover, if no category is provided, then the result is identical
    with the result for the meet of the categories of the domain and
    the codomain::

        sage: Hom(QQ, ZZ) is Hom(QQ,ZZ, Category.meet([QQ.category(), ZZ.category()]))
        True

    Some doc tests in :mod:`sage.rings` (need to) break the unique
    parent assumption. But if domain or codomain are not unique
    parents, then the homset will not fit. That is to say, the hom set
    found in the cache will have a (co)domain that is equal to, but
    not identical with, the given (co)domain.

    By :issue:`9138`, we abandon the uniqueness of homsets, if the
    domain or codomain break uniqueness::

        sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring import MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain
        sage: P.<x,y,z>=MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain(QQ, 3, order='degrevlex')
        sage: Q.<x,y,z>=MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain(QQ, 3, order='degrevlex')
        sage: P == Q
        True
        sage: P is Q
        False

    Hence, ``P`` and ``Q`` are not unique parents. By consequence, the
    following homsets aren't either::

        sage: H1 = Hom(QQ,P)
        sage: H2 = Hom(QQ,Q)
        sage: H1 == H2
        True
        sage: H1 is H2
        False

    It is always the most recently constructed homset that remains in
    the cache::

        sage: H2 is Hom(QQ,Q)
        True

    Variation on the theme::

        sage: # needs sage.modules
        sage: U1 = FreeModule(ZZ, 2)
        sage: U2 = FreeModule(ZZ, 2, inner_product_matrix=matrix([[1,0], [0,-1]]))
        sage: U1 == U2, U1 is U2
        (False, False)
        sage: V = ZZ^3
        sage: H1 = Hom(U1, V); H2 = Hom(U2, V)
        sage: H1 == H2, H1 is H2
        (False, False)
        sage: H1 = Hom(V, U1); H2 = Hom(V, U2)
        sage: H1 == H2, H1 is H2
        (False, False)

    Since :issue:`11900`, the meet of the categories of the given arguments is
    used to determine the default category of the homset. This can also be a
    join category, as in the following example::

        sage: PA = Parent(category=Algebras(QQ))
        sage: PJ = Parent(category=Rings() & Modules(QQ))
        sage: Hom(PA, PJ)
        Set of Homomorphisms
         from <sage.structure.parent.Parent object at ...>
           to <sage.structure.parent.Parent object at ...>
        sage: Hom(PA, PJ).category()
        Category of homsets of
         unital magmas and right modules over Rational Field
          and left modules over Rational Field
        sage: Hom(PA, PJ, Rngs())
        Set of Morphisms
         from <sage.structure.parent.Parent object at ...>
           to <sage.structure.parent.Parent object at ...> in Category of rngs

    .. TODO::

        - Design decision: how much of the homset comes from the
          category of ``X`` and ``Y``, and how much from the specific
          ``X`` and ``Y``.  In particular, do we need several parent
          classes depending on ``X`` and ``Y``, or does the difference
          only lie in the elements (i.e.  the morphism), and of course
          how the parent calls their constructors.
        - Specify the protocol for the ``_Hom_`` hook in case of ambiguity
          (e.g. if both a parent and some category thereof provide one).

    TESTS:

    Facade parents over plain Python types are supported::

        sage: from sage.sets.pythonclass import Set_PythonType
        sage: R = Set_PythonType(int)
        sage: S = Set_PythonType(float)
        sage: Hom(R, S)
        Set of Morphisms from Set of Python objects of class 'int' to Set of Python objects of class 'float' in Category of sets

    Checks that the domain and codomain are in the specified
    category. Case of a non parent::

        sage: # needs sage.graphs
        sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[1,2], [1,4]]); S.rename('S')
        sage: Hom(S, S, SimplicialComplexes())
        Set of Morphisms from S to S in Category of finite simplicial complexes
        sage: Hom(Set(), S, Sets())
        Set of Morphisms from {} to S in Category of sets
        sage: Hom(S, Set(), Sets())
        Set of Morphisms from S to {} in Category of sets
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, ChainComplexes(QQ))
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: S is not in Category of chain complexes over Rational Field

    Those checks are done with the natural idiom ``X in category``,
    and not ``X.category().is_subcategory(category)`` as it used to be
    before :issue:`16275` (see :issue:`15801` for a real use case)::

        sage: # needs sage.graphs
        sage: class PermissiveCategory(Category):
        ....:     def super_categories(self): return [Objects()]
        ....:     def __contains__(self, X): return True
        sage: C = PermissiveCategory(); C.rename('Permissive category')
        sage: S.category().is_subcategory(C)
        False
        sage: S in C
        True
        sage: Hom(S, S, C)
        Set of Morphisms from S to S in Permissive category

    With ``check=False``, uninitialized parents, as can appear upon
    unpickling, are supported. Case of a parent::

        sage: cls = type(Set())
        sage: S = unpickle_newobj(cls, ())  # A non parent
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, SimplicialComplexes(), check=False)
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, Sets(),                check=False)
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, ChainComplexes(QQ),    check=False)

    Case of a non parent::

        sage: # needs sage.graphs
        sage: cls = type(SimplicialComplex([[1,2], [1,4]]))
        sage: S = unpickle_newobj(cls, ())
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, Sets(),                check=False)
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, Groups(),              check=False)
        sage: H = Hom(S, S, SimplicialComplexes(), check=False)

    Typical example where unpickling involves calling Hom on an
    uninitialized parent::

        sage: P.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']
        sage: Q = P.quotient([x^2 - 1, y^2 - 1])
        sage: q = Q.an_element()                                                        # needs sage.libs.singular
        sage: explain_pickle(dumps(Q))                                                  # needs sage.libs.singular
        pg_...
        ... = pg_dynamic_class('QuotientRing_generic_with_category', (pg_QuotientRing_generic, pg_getattr(..., 'parent_class')), None, None, pg_QuotientRing_generic)
        si... = unpickle_newobj(..., ())
        ...
        si... = pg_unpickle_MPolynomialRing_libsingular(..., ('x', 'y'), ...)
        si... = ... pg_Hom(si..., si..., ...) ...
        sage: Q == loads(dumps(Q))
        True

    Check that the ``_Hom_`` method of the ``category`` input is used::

        sage: from sage.categories.category_types import Category_over_base_ring

    To avoid creating superfluous categories, a homset in a category
    ``Cs()`` is in the homset category of the lowest full super category
    ``Bs()`` of ``Cs()`` that implements ``Bs.Homsets`` (or the join
    thereof if there are several). For example, finite groups form a
    full subcategory of unital magmas: any unital magma morphism
    between two finite groups is a finite group morphism. Since finite
    groups currently implement nothing more than unital magmas about
    their homsets, we have::

        sage: # needs sage.groups
        sage: G = GL(3, 3)

        Category of finite groups
        sage: H.category()
        Category of endsets of unital magmas

    Similarly, a ring morphism just needs to preserve addition,
    multiplication, zero, and one. Accordingly, and since the category
    of rings implements nothing specific about its homsets, a ring
    homset is currently constructed in the category of homsets of
    unital magmas and unital additive magmas::

        sage: H = Hom(ZZ,ZZ,Rings())

            It can happen, that ``Hom(X,X)`` is called during

        An abstract class for the elements of this homset.

        This class is built from the element class of the homset
        category and the morphism class of the category.  This makes
        it possible for a category to provide code for its morphisms
        and for morphisms of all its subcategories, full or not.

        .. NOTE::

            The element class of ``C.Homsets()`` will be inherited by
            morphisms in *full* subcategories of ``C``, while the morphism
            class of ``C`` will be inherited by *all* subcategories of
            ``C``. Hence, if some feature of a morphism depends on the
            algebraic properties of the homsets, it should be implemented by
            ``C.Homsets.ElementMethods``, but if it depends only on the
            algebraic properties of domain and codomain, it should be
            implemented in ``C.MorphismMethods``.

            At this point, the homset element classes take precedence over the
            morphism classes. But this may be subject to change.


        .. TODO::

            - Make sure this class is shared whenever possible.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a homset of finite commutative groups as example; at
        this point this is the simplest one to create (gosh)::

            sage: # needs sage.groups
            sage: cat = Groups().Finite().Commutative()
            sage: C3 = PermutationGroup([(1,2,3)])
            sage: C3._refine_category_(cat)
            sage: C2 = PermutationGroup([(1,2)])
            sage: C2._refine_category_(cat)
            sage: H = Hom(C3, C2, cat)
            sage: H.homset_category()
            Category of finite commutative groups
            sage: H.category()
            Category of homsets of unital magmas
            sage: cls = H._abstract_element_class; cls
            <class 'sage.categories.homsets.GroupHomset_libgap_with_category._abstract_element_class'>
            sage: cls.__bases__ == (H.category().element_class, H.homset_category().morphism_class)
            True

        A morphism of finite commutative semigroups is also a morphism
        of semigroups, of magmas, ...; it thus inherits code from all
        those categories::

            sage: # needs sage.groups
            sage: issubclass(cls, Semigroups().Finite().morphism_class)
            True
            sage: issubclass(cls, Semigroups().morphism_class)

            True
            sage: issubclass(cls, Sets().morphism_class)
            True

        Recall that FiniteMonoids() is a full subcategory of
        ``Monoids()``, but not of ``FiniteSemigroups()``. Thus::

            sage: issubclass(cls, Monoids().Finite().Homsets().element_class)           # needs sage.groups
            True
            sage: issubclass(cls, Semigroups().Finite().Homsets().element_class)        # needs sage.groups
