Manin relations for overconvergent modular symbols

Code to create the Manin Relations class, which solves the "Manin relations".
That is, a description of `Div^0(P^1(\QQ))` as a `\ZZ[\Gamma_0(N)]`-module in
terms of generators and relations is found. The method used is geometric,
constructing a nice fundamental domain for `\Gamma_0(N)` and reading the
relevant Manin relations off of that picture. The algorithm follows [PS2011]_.

        This function does some precomputations needed to compute `T_l`.

        In particular, if `\phi` is a modular symbol and `D_m` is the divisor
        associated to the generator ``gen``, to compute `(\phi|T_{l})(D_m)` one
        needs to compute `\phi(\gamma_a D_m)|\gamma_a` where `\gamma_a` runs
        through the `l+1` matrices defining `T_l`.  One
        then takes `\gamma_a D_m` and writes it as a sum of unimodular
        divisors.  For each such unimodular divisor, say `[M]` where `M` is a
        `SL_2` matrix, we then write `M=\gamma h` where `\gamma` is in
        `\Gamma_0(N)` and `h` is one of our chosen coset representatives.  Then
        `\phi([M]) = \phi([h]) | \gamma^{-1}`.  Thus, one has

        .. MATH::

            (\phi | \gamma_a)(D_m) = \sum_h \sum_j \phi([h]) | \gamma_{hj}^{-1} \cdot \gamma_a

        as `h` runs over all coset representatives and `j` simply runs over
        however many times `M_h` appears in the above computation.

        Finally, the output of this function is a dictionary ``D``
        whose keys are the coset representatives in ``self.reps()``
        where each value is a list of matrices, and the entries of
        ``D`` satisfy:
