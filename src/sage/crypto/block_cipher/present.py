PRESENT

An ultra-lightweight block cipher.

This file implements the PRESENT block cipher and the corresponding key
schedule as described in [BKLPPRSV2007]_. PRESENT is an example of an
SP-network and consists of 31 rounds. The block length is 64 bits and two key
lengths of 80 and 128 bits are supported.

This implementation is meant for experimental and educational usage only,
do not use it in production code!

EXAMPLES:

Encrypt a message::

    sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT
    sage: present = PRESENT()
    sage: present.encrypt(plaintext=0, key=0).hex()
    '2844b365c06992a3'

And decrypt it again::

    sage: present.decrypt(ciphertext=0x2844b365c06992a3, key=0)
    0

Have a look at the used round keys::

    sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT_KS
    sage: ks = PRESENT_KS()
    sage: [k.hex() for k in ks(0)]
    ['0',
     'c000000000000000',
      ...
     '6dab31744f41d700']

Tweak around with the cipher::

    sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
    sage: cipher = PRESENT(rounds=1, doFinalRound=False)
    sage: cipher.sbox = SBox(range(16))
    sage: cipher.keySchedule = lambda x: [0, 0]  # return the 0 keys as round keys
    sage: cipher.encrypt(plaintext=0x1234, key=0x0).hex()
    '1234'

    This class implements PRESENT described in [BKLPPRSV2007]_.

    EXAMPLES:

    You can invoke PRESENT encryption/decryption either by calling PRESENT with
    an appropriate flag::

        sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT
        sage: present = PRESENT()
        sage: P = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
        sage: K = 0x0
        sage: present(present(P, K, 'encrypt'), K, 'decrypt') == P
        True

    Or by calling encryption/decryption methods directly::

        sage: C = present.encrypt(P, K)
        sage: P == present.decrypt(C, K)
        True

    The number of rounds can be reduced easily::

        sage: present = PRESENT(rounds=15)
        sage: present(present(P, K, 'encrypt'), K, 'decrypt') == P
        True

    You can use integers or a list-like bit representation for the inputs. If
    the input is an integer the output will be too. If it is list-like the
    output will be a bit vector::

        sage: P = ZZ(0).digits(2,padto=64)
        sage: K = ZZ(0).digits(2,padto=80)
        sage: list(present(present(P, K, 'encrypt'), K, 'decrypt')) == P
        True
        sage: P = ZZ(0).digits(2,padto=64)
        sage: K = 0x0
        sage: list(present(present(P, K, 'encrypt'), K, 'decrypt')) == P
        True

    The 80-bit version of PRESENT is used by default but the 128-bit version is
    also implemented::

        sage: present = PRESENT(128)
        sage: P = 0x0123456789abcdef
        sage: K = 0x00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
        sage: present(present(P, K, 'encrypt'), K, 'decrypt') == P
        True

    def __init__(self, keySchedule=80, rounds=None, doFinalRound=False):
        r"""
        Construct an instance of PRESENT.

        INPUT:

        - ``keySchedule`` -- (default: ``80``) the key schedule that will be
          used for encryption and decryption. Use ``80`` or ``128`` as a
          shortcut for the original key schedules from [BKLPPRSV2007]_.

        - ``rounds`` -- integer (default: ``None``); the number of rounds. If
          ``None`` the number of rounds of the key schedule is used.

        - ``doFinalRound`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); flag to
          control whether the linear layer in the last round should take place
          or not. Since the last linear layer does not add any security, it
          usually does not take place in real world implementations for
          performance reasons.

        EXAMPLES:

        By default a 80-bit version with 31 rounds is created::

            sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT
            sage: PRESENT() # indirect doctest
            PRESENT block cipher with 31 rounds, deactivated linear layer in
            last round and the following key schedule:
            Original PRESENT key schedule with 80-bit keys and 31 rounds

        The 128-bit version is also implemented::

            sage: PRESENT(128) # indirect doctest
            PRESENT block cipher with 31 rounds, deactivated linear layer in
            last round and the following key schedule:
            Original PRESENT key schedule with 128-bit keys and 31 rounds

        Reducing the number of rounds is simple. But increasing it is not
        possible::

            sage: PRESENT(keySchedule=80, rounds=23) # indirect doctest
            PRESENT block cipher with 23 rounds, deactivated linear layer in
            last round and the following key schedule:
            Original PRESENT key schedule with 80-bit keys and 31 rounds
            sage: PRESENT(80, 32) # indirect doctest
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: number of rounds must be less or equal to the number
            of rounds of the key schedule


        By default the linear layer operation in the last round is omitted but
        of course you can enable it::

            sage: PRESENT(doFinalRound=True) # indirect doctest
            PRESENT block cipher with 31 rounds, activated linear layer in
            last round and the following key schedule:
            Original PRESENT key schedule with 80-bit keys and 31 rounds

        You can use arbitrary key schedules. Since it is the only one
        implemented here the original key schedule is used for demonstration::

            sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT_KS
            sage: PRESENT(keySchedule=PRESENT_KS(80, 15)) # indirect doctest
            PRESENT block cipher with 15 rounds, deactivated linear layer in
            last round and the following key schedule:

        Each of the 31 rounds consists of an XOR operation to introduce a round

        post-whitening, a linear bitwise permutation and a non-linear
        substitution layer. The non-linear layer uses a single 4-bit S-box
        which is applied 16 times in parallel in each round. Each stage but
        addRoundkey is specified in its corresponding function.

    This class implements the PRESENT key schedules for both 80-bit and 128-bit
    keys as described in [BKLPPRSV2007]_.

    EXAMPLES:

    Initialise the key schedule with a `master\_key` to use it as an iterable::

        sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import PRESENT_KS
        sage: ks = PRESENT_KS(master_key=0)
        sage: ks[0] == 0x0
        True
        sage: ks[31] == 0x6dab31744f41d700
        True

    Or omit the `master\_key` and pass a key when calling the key schedule::

        sage: ks = PRESENT_KS(keysize=128)
        sage: K = ks(0x00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff)
        sage: K[0] == 0x0011223344556677
        True
        sage: K[31] == 0x091989a5ae8eab21
        True

    ALGORITHM:

    Description of the key schedule for 64-bit and 128-bit keys from
    [BKLPPRSV2007]_:

    The key schedule for 64-bit keys works as follows:

    At round `i` the 64-bit round key `K_i = \kappa_{63}\kappa_{62} \dots
    \kappa_0` consists of the 64 leftmost bits of the current contents of
    register `K`. Thus at round `i` we have that:

    .. MATH::

        K_i = \kappa_{63}\kappa_{62}\dots \kappa_0 = k_{79}k_{78}\dots k_{16}.

    After extracting the round key `K_i`, the key register `K = k_{79}k_{78}
    \dots k_0` is updated as follows:

    .. MATH::

        \begin{aligned}
        \ [k_{79}k_{78}\dots k_{1}k_{0}] &= [k_{18}k_{17}\dots k_{20}k_{19}] \\
        [k_{79}k_{78}k_{77}k_{76}] &= S[k_{79}k_{78}k_{77}k_{76}] \\
        [k_{19}k_{18}k_{17}k_{16}k_{15}] &= [k_{19}k_{18}k_{17}k_{16}k_{15}]
                                            \oplus round\_counter
        \end{aligned}

    Thus, the key register is rotated by 61 bit positions to the left, the
    left-most four bits are passed through the PRESENT S-box, and the
    round_counter value `i` is exclusive-ored with bits `k_{19}k_{18}k_{17}
    k_{16}k_{15}` of `K` with the least significant bit of round_counter on
    the right.

    The key schedule for 128-bit keys works as follows:

    At round `i` the 64-bit round key `K_i = \kappa_{63}\kappa_{62} \dots
    \kappa_0` consists of the 64 leftmost bits fo the current contents of
    register `K`. Thus at round `i` we have that:

    .. MATH::

        K_i = \kappa_{63}\kappa_{62}\dots \kappa_0 = k_{127}k_{126}\dots k_{64}

    After extracting the round key `K_i`, the key register `K = k_{127}k_{126}
    \dots k_0` is updated as follows:

    .. MATH::

        \begin{aligned}
        \ [k_{127}k_{126}\dots k_{1}k_{0}] &= [k_{66}k_{65}\dots k_{68}k_{67}]
        \\
        [k_{127}k_{126}k_{125}k_{124}] &= S[k_{127}k_{126}k_{125}k_{124}]\\
        [k_{123}k_{122}k_{121}k_{120}] &= S[k_{123}k_{122}k_{121}k_{120}]\\
        [k_{66}k_{65}k_{64}k_{63}k_{62}] &= [k_{66}k_{65}k_{64}k_{63}k_{62}]
                                            \oplus round\_counter
        \end{aligned}

    Thus, the key register is rotated by 61 bit positions to the left, the
    left-most eight bits are passed through two PRESENT S-boxes, and the
    round_counter value `i` is exclusive-ored with bits `k_{66}k_{65}k_{64}
    k_{63}k_{62}` of `K` with the least significant bit of round_counter on
    the right.
