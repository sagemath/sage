Weighted projective curves

Weighted projective curves in Sage are curves in a weighted projective space or
a weighted projective plane.

EXAMPLES:

For now, only curves in weighted projective plane is supported::

    sage: WP.<x, y, z> = WeightedProjectiveSpace([1, 3, 1], QQ)
    sage: C1 = WP.curve(y^2 - x^5 * z - 3 * x^2 * z^4 - 2 * z^6); C1
    Weighted Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by y^2 - x^5*z - 3*x^2*z^4 - 2*z^6
    sage: C2 = Curve(y^2 - x^5 * z - 3 * x^2 * z^4 - 2 * z^6, WP); C2
    Weighted Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by y^2 - x^5*z - 3*x^2*z^4 - 2*z^6
    sage: C1 == C2
    True

        Return this weighted projective curve as a projective curve.

        A weighted homogeneous polynomial `f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)`, where `x_i` has
        weight `w_i`, can be viewed as an unweighted homogeneous polynomial
        `f(y_1^{w_1}, \ldots, y_n^{w_n})`. This correspondence extends to
        varieties.

        .. TODO:

            Implement homsets for weighted projective spaces and implement this
            as a ``projective_embedding`` method instead.
