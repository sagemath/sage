Some functions regarding geometric endomorphism rings of Jacobians of
hyperelliptic curves.

There are currently two main functions in this module, associated to the
Jacobian `J` of a genus 2 curve over the rational numbers `\QQ`:

- ``get_is_geom_field``
- ``is_geom_trivial_when_field``

``get_is_geom_field`` determines whether the geometric endomorphism
algebra \textup{End}_{\overline{\QQ}}(J) \otimes \QQ` is a field.

``is_geom_trivial_when_field`` determines whether the geometric endomorphism ring
`\textup{End}_{\overline{\QQ}}(J)` is equal to the integer ring `\ZZ`, assuming
the geometric endomorphism algebra is a field. If this is the case, one says
that `J` is ``generic``.

These functions are used in `jacobian_generic.py` in the following two
analogous methods associated to the Jacobian `J` of a genus 2 curve over the
rational numbers `\QQ`:

- ``geometric_endomorphism_algebra_is_field(J)``
- ``geometric_endomorphism_ring_is_ZZ(J)``

Both of these are important attributes of the Jacobian J.

The algorithms in the functions in this module are implementations of
Algorithms 4.10 and 4.15 from Lombardo's paper [Lom2019]_.

The following examples have been verified with the corresponding LMFDB entries.

EXAMPLES:

Here is an example of a generic Jacobian; the LMFDB label of the curve is
249.a.249.1::

    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: f = x^6 + 2*x^3 + 4*x^2 + 4*x + 1
    sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
    sage: A = C.jacobian()
    sage: A.geometric_endomorphism_ring_is_ZZ()
    True

Here is an example of a Jacobian whose endomorphism algebra is a field but not
the rational number field; the LMFDB label of the curve is 529.a.529.1::

    sage: f = x^6 - 4*x^5 + 2*x^4 + 2*x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 1
    sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
    sage: A = C.jacobian()
    sage: A.geometric_endomorphism_algebra_is_field()
    True
    sage: A.geometric_endomorphism_ring_is_ZZ()
    False

Here is an example of a Jacobian whose endomorphism algebra is not a field;
the LMFDB label of the curve is 169.a.169.1::

    sage: f = x^6 + 4*x^5 + 6*x^4 + 2*x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 1
    sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
    sage: A = C.jacobian()
    sage: A.geometric_endomorphism_algebra_is_field()
    False

.. WARNING::

    There is a very small chance that the algorithms return ``False`` for the
    two methods described above when in fact one or both of them are ``True``.
    In this case, as explained in the discussion immediately preceding
    Algorithm 4.15 of [Lom2019]_, this can be established by increasing the
    optional `B` parameter of the two methods. Mathematically, the algorithms
    give the correct answer only in the limit as `B \to \infty`, although in
    practice `B = 200` was sufficient to correctly verify every single entry
    in the LMFDB.

def get_is_geom_field(f, C, bad_primes, B=200):

    Determine whether the geometric endomorphism algebra is a field.

    This is Algorithm 4.10 in [Lom2019]_. The computation done here
    may allow one to immediately conclude that the geometric endomorphism
    ring is trivial (i.e. the integer ring); this information is output
    in a second boolean to avoid unnecessary subsequent computation.

    An additional optimisation comes from Part (2) of Theorem 4.8 in
    [Lom2019]_, from which we can conclude that the endomorphism ring
    is geometrically trivial, and from Proposition 4.7 in loc. cit. from
    which we can rule out potential QM.

    INPUT:

    - ``f`` -- a polynomial defining the hyperelliptic curve

    - ``C`` -- the hyperelliptic curve

    - ``bad_primes`` -- the list of odd primes of bad reduction

    - ``B`` -- (default: 200) the bound which appears in the statement of
      the algorithm from [Lom2019]_

    OUTPUT:

    Pair of booleans (bool1, bool2). `bool1` indicates if the
    geometric endomorphism algebra is a field; `bool2` indicates if the
    geometric endomorphism algebra is the field of rational numbers.

    practice `B = 200` was sufficient to correctly verify every single entry

    function is not provably ``False``.
