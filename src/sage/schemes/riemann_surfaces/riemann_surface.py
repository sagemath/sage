Riemann matrices and endomorphism rings of algebraic Riemann surfaces

This module provides a class, :class:`RiemannSurface`, to model the
Riemann surface determined by a plane algebraic curve over a subfield
of the complex numbers.

A homology basis is derived from the edges of a Voronoi cell decomposition based
on the branch locus. The pull-back of these edges to the Riemann surface
provides a graph on it that contains a homology basis.

The class provides methods for computing the Riemann period matrix of the
surface numerically, using a certified homotopy continuation method due to
[Kr2016]_.

The class also provides facilities for computing the endomorphism ring of the
period lattice numerically, by determining integer (near) solutions to the
relevant approximate linear equations.

One can also calculate the Abel-Jacobi map on the Riemann surface, and there
is basic functionality to interface with divisors of curves to facilitate this.

- Nils Bruin, Jeroen Sijsling (2018-01-05): algebraization, isomorphisms

- Linden Disney-Hogg, Nils Bruin (2022-09-07): Abel-Jacobi map

EXAMPLES:

We compute the Riemann matrix of a genus 3 curve::

    sage: from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
    sage: f = x^4-x^3*y+2*x^3+2*x^2*y+2*x^2-2*x*y^2+4*x*y-y^3+3*y^2+2*y+1
    sage: S = RiemannSurface(f, prec=100)
    sage: M = S.riemann_matrix()

We test the usual properties, i.e., that the period matrix is symmetric and that
the imaginary part is positive definite::

    sage: all(abs(a) < 1e-20 for a in (M-M.T).list())
    True
    sage: iM = Matrix(RDF,3,3,[a.imag_part() for a in M.list()])
    sage: iM.is_positive_definite()
    True

We compute the endomorphism ring and check it has `\ZZ`-rank 6::

    sage: A = S.endomorphism_basis(80,8)
    sage: len(A) == 6
    True

In fact it is an order in a number field::

    sage: T.<t> = QQ[]
    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^6 - t^5 + 2*t^4 + 8*t^3 - t^2 - 5*t + 7)
    sage: all(len(a.minpoly().roots(K)) == a.minpoly().degree() for a in A)
    True

We can look at an extended example of the Abel-Jacobi functionality. We will
demonstrate a particular half-canonical divisor on Klein's Curve, known in
the literature::

    sage: f = x^3*y + y^3 + x
    sage: S = RiemannSurface(f, integration_method='rigorous')
    sage: BL = S.places_at_branch_locus(); BL
    [Place (x, y, y^2),
     Place (x^7 + 27/4, y + 4/9*x^5, y^2 + 4/3*x^3),
     Place (x^7 + 27/4, y - 2/9*x^5, y^2 + 1/3*x^3)]

We can read off out the output of ``places_at_branch_locus`` to choose our
divisor, and we can calculate the canonical divisor using curve functionality::

    sage: P0 = 1*BL[0]
    sage: from sage.schemes.curves.constructor import Curve
    sage: C = Curve(f)
    sage: F = C.function_field()
    sage: K = (F(x).differential()).divisor() - F(f.derivative(y)).divisor()
    sage: Pinf, Pinf_prime = C.places_at_infinity()
    sage: if K-3*Pinf-1*Pinf_prime: Pinf, Pinf_prime = (Pinf_prime, Pinf);
    sage: D = P0 + 2*Pinf - Pinf_prime

Note we could check using exact techniques that `2D = K`::

    sage: Z = K - 2*D
    sage: (Z.degree() == 0, len(Z.basis_differential_space()) == S.genus, len(Z.basis_function_space()) == 1)
    (True, True, True)

We can also check this using our Abel-Jacobi functions::

    sage: avoid = C.places_at_infinity()
    sage: Zeq, _ = S.strong_approximation(Z, avoid)
    sage: Zlist = S.divisor_to_divisor_list(Zeq)
    sage: AJ = S.abel_jacobi(Zlist)  # long time (1 second)
    sage: S.reduce_over_period_lattice(AJ).norm() < 1e-10  # long time
    True

def voronoi_ghost(cpoints, n=6, CC=CDF):
    r"""
    Convert a set of complex points to a list of real tuples `(x,y)`, and
    appends n points in a big circle around them.

    The effect is that, with n >= 3, a Voronoi decomposition will have only
    finite cells around the original points. Furthermore, because the extra
    points are placed on a circle centered on the average of the given points,
    with a radius 3/2 times the largest distance between the center and the
    given points, these finite cells form a simply connected region.

    INPUT:

    A list of real tuples `(x,y)` consisting of the original points and a set of
    points which surround them.

def differential_basis_baker(f):
    r"""
    Compute a differential basis for a curve that is nonsingular outside (1:0:0),(0:1:0),(0:0:1).

    Baker's theorem tells us that if a curve has its singularities at the coordinate vertices and meets
    some further easily tested genericity criteria,
    then we can read off a basis for the regular differentials from the interior of the
    Newton polygon spanned by the monomials. While this theorem only applies to special plane curves
    it is worth implementing because the analysis is relatively cheap and it applies to a lot of
    commonly encountered curves (e.g., curves given by a hyperelliptic model). Other advantages include
    that we can do the computation over any exact base ring (the alternative Singular based method for
    computing the adjoint ideal requires the rationals), and that we can avoid being affected by subtle bugs
    in the Singular code.

    ``None`` is returned when ``f`` does not describe a curve of the relevant type. If ``f`` is of the relevant
    type, but is of genus `0` then ``[]`` is returned (which are both False values, but they are not equal).

def reparameterize_differential_minpoly(minpoly, z0):

    Rewrites a minimal polynomial to write is around `z_0`.

    Given a minimal polynomial `m(z,g)`, where `g` corresponds to a differential
    on the surface (that is, it is represented as a rational function, and
    implicitly carries a factor `dz`), we rewrite the minpoly in terms of
    variables `\bar{z}, \bar{g}` s.t now `\bar{z}=0 \Leftrightarrow z=z_0`.

    INPUT:

    - ``minpoly`` -- a polynomial in two variables, where the first variable
      corresponds to the base coordinate on the Riemann surface
    - ``z0`` -- complex number or infinity; the point about which to
      reparameterize

    OUTPUT: a polynomial in two variables giving the reparameterize minimal polynomial

    EXAMPLES:

    On the curve given by `w^2 - z^3 + 1 = 0`, we have differential
    `\frac{dz}{2w} = \frac{dz}{2\sqrt{z^3-1}}`
    with minimal polynomial `g^2(z^3-1) - 1/4=0`. We can make the substitution
    `\bar{z}=z^{-1}` to parameterise the differential about `z=\infty` as

    .. MATH::

        \frac{-\bar{z}^{-2} d\bar{z}}{2\sqrt{\bar{z}^{-3}-1}} = \frac{-d\bar{z}}{2\sqrt{\bar{z}(1-\bar{z}^3)}}.

    Hence the transformed differential should have minimal polynomial
    `\bar{g}^2 \bar{z} (1 - \bar{z}^3) - 1/4 = 0`, and we can check this::

    We can further check that reparameterising about `0` is the identity
    operation::

        sage: reparameterize_differential_minpoly(minpoly, 0)(*minpoly.parent().gens()) == minpoly
        True

    .. NOTE::

        As part of the routine, when reparameterising about infinity, a
        rational function is reduced and then the numerator is taken. Over
        an inexact ring this is numerically unstable, and so it is advisable
        to only reparameterize about infinity over an exact ring.

class RiemannSurface:
    r"""
    Construct a Riemann Surface. This is specified by the zeroes of a bivariate
    polynomial with rational coefficients `f(z,w) = 0`.

    INPUT:

    - ``f`` -- a bivariate polynomial with rational coefficients. The surface is
      interpreted as the covering space of the coordinate plane in the first
      variable.

    - ``prec`` -- the desired precision of computations on the surface in bits
      (default: 53)

    - ``certification`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); value indicating
      whether homotopy continuation is certified or not. Uncertified
      homotopy continuation can be faster.

    - ``differentials`` -- (default: ``None``) if specified, provides a list
      of polynomials `h` such that `h/(df/dw) dz` is a regular
      differential on the Riemann surface. This is taken as a basis of
      the regular differentials, so the genus is assumed to be equal
      to the length of this list. The results from the homology basis
      computation are checked against this value.  Providing this
      parameter makes the computation independent from Singular.  For
      a nonsingular plane curve of degree `d`, an appropriate set is
      given by the monomials of degree up to `d-3`.

    - ``integration_method`` -- (default: ``'rigorous'``). String specifying the
      integration method to use when calculating the integrals of differentials.
      The options are ``'heuristic'`` and ``'rigorous'``, the latter of
      which is often the most efficient.

    We can also work with Riemann surfaces that are defined over fields with a
    complex embedding, but since the current interface for computing genus and
    regular differentials in Singular presently does not support extensions of
    `\QQ`, we need to specify a description of the differentials ourselves. We give
    an example of a CM elliptic curve::

        sage: Qt.<t> = QQ[]
        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^2-t+3,embedding=CC(0.5+1.6*I))
        sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
        sage: f = y^2 + y - (x^3 + (1-a)*x^2 - (2+a)*x - 2)
        sage: S = RiemannSurface(f, prec=100, differentials=[1])
        sage: A = S.endomorphism_basis()
        sage: len(A)
        2
        sage: all(len(T.minpoly().roots(K)) > 0 for T in A)
        True

    The ``'heuristic'`` integration method uses the method ``integrate_vector``
    defined in ``sage.numerical.gauss_legendre`` to compute integrals of differentials.
    As mentioned there, this works by iteratively doubling the number of nodes
    used in the quadrature, and uses a heuristic based on the rate at which the
    result is seemingly converging to estimate the error. The ``'rigorous'``
    method uses results from [Neu2018]_, and bounds the algebraic integrands on
    circular domains using Cauchy's form of the remainder in Taylor approximation
    coupled to Fujiwara's bound on polynomial roots (see Bruin-DisneyHogg-Gao,
    in preparation). Note this method of bounding on circular domains is also
    implemented in :meth:`_compute_delta`. The net result of this bounding is
    that one can know (an upper bound on) the number of nodes required to achieve
    a certain error. This means that for any given integral, assuming that the
    same number of nodes is required by both methods in order to achieve the
    desired error (not necessarily true in practice), approximately half
    the number of integrand evaluations are required. When the required number
    of nodes is high, e.g. when the precision required is high, this can make
    the ``'rigorous'`` method much faster. However, the ``'rigorous'`` method does
    not benefit as much from the caching of the ``nodes`` method over multiple
    integrals. The result of this is that, for calls of :meth:`matrix_of_integral_values`
    if the computation is 'fast', the heuristic method may outperform the
    rigorous method, but for slower computations the rigorous method can be much
    faster::

        sage: f = z*w^3 + z^3 + w
        sage: p = 53
        sage: Sh = RiemannSurface(f, prec=p, integration_method='heuristic')
        sage: Sr = RiemannSurface(f, prec=p, integration_method='rigorous')
        sage: from sage.numerical.gauss_legendre import nodes
        sage: import time
        sage: nodes.cache.clear()
        sage: ct = time.time()
        sage: Rh = Sh.riemann_matrix()
        sage: ct1 = time.time()-ct
        sage: nodes.cache.clear()
        sage: ct = time.time()
        sage: Rr = Sr.riemann_matrix()
        sage: ct2 = time.time()-ct
        sage: ct2/ct1  # random
        1.2429363969691192

    Note that for the above curve, the branch points are evenly distributed, and
    hence the implicit assumptions in the heuristic method are more sensible,
    meaning that a higher precision is required to see the heuristic method
    being significantly slower than the rigorous method. For a worse conditioned
    curve, this effect is more pronounced::

        sage: q = 1 / 10
        sage: f = y^2 - (x^2 - 2*x + 1 + q^2) * (x^2 + 2*x + 1 + q^2)
        sage: p = 500
        sage: Sh = RiemannSurface(f, prec=p, integration_method='heuristic')
        sage: Sr = RiemannSurface(f, prec=p, integration_method='rigorous')
        sage: nodes.cache.clear()
        sage: Rh = Sh.riemann_matrix()  # long time (8 seconds)
        sage: nodes.cache.clear()
        sage: Rr = Sr.riemann_matrix()  # long time (1 seconds)

    This disparity in timings can get increasingly worse, and testing has shown
    that even for random quadrics the heuristic method can be as bad as 30 times
    slower.

    TESTS:

    This elliptic curve has a relatively poorly conditioned set of branch
    points, so it challenges the path choice a bit. The code just verifies that
    the period is quadratic, because the curve has CM, but really the test is
    that the computation completes at all.::

        r"""
        Compute the permutations of branches associated to each edge.

        Over the vertices of the Voronoi decomposition around the branch locus,
        we label the fibres. By following along an edge, the lifts of the edge
        induce a permutation of that labelling.

        OUTPUT:

        A dictionary with as keys the edges of the Voronoi decomposition and as
        values the corresponding permutations.

    def monodromy_group(self):
        r"""
        Compute local monodromy generators of the Riemann surface.

        For each branch point, the local monodromy is encoded by a permutation.
        The permutations returned correspond to positively oriented loops around
        each branch point, with a fixed base point. This means the generators
        are properly conjugated to ensure that together they generate the global
        monodromy. The list has an entry for every finite point stored in
        ``self.branch_locus``, plus an entry for the ramification above infinity.

        OUTPUT:

        A list of permutations, encoding the local monodromy at each branch
        point.

        EXAMPLES::

        Perform vectorized integration along a straight path.

        Using the error bounds for Gauss-Legendre integration found in [Neu2018]_

        using Cauchy's form of the remainder in Taylor approximation coupled to
        Fujiwara's bound on polynomial roots (see Bruin-DisneyHogg-Gao, in

          corresponding to an edge of the upstairs graph, or a tuple
          ``((z_start, sb), (z_end, ))`` as in the input of

          the equation defining the Riemann surface

          :meth:`_bounding_data`.

            Uses data that ``homology_basis`` initializes, and may give incorrect
            values if :meth:`homology_basis` has not initialized them.

            Note also that the data of the differentials is contained within
            ``bounding_data``. It is, however, still advantageous to have this
            be a separate argument, as it lets the user supply a fast-callable
            version of the differentials, to significantly speed up execution
            of the integrand calls, and not have to re-calculate these
            fast-callables for every run of the function. This is also the benefit
            of representing the  differentials as a polynomial over a known
            common denominator.

        .. TODO::

            Note that bounding_data contains the information of the integrands,
            so one may want to check for consistency between ``bounding_data``
            and ``differentials``. If so one would not want to do so at the
            expense of speed.

            Moreover, the current implementation bounds along a line by
            splitting it up into segments, each of which can be covered entirely

            required to bound as per [Neu2018]_. This is reliably more efficient
            than the heuristic method, especially in poorly-conditioned cases
            where discriminant points are close together around the edges, but
            in the case where the branch locus is well separated, it can require
            slightly more nodes than necessary. One may want to include a method

            entire line with one ellipse, then bounds along that ellipse with
            multiple circles.

        Integrate the cohomology basis along a straight line edge.

        The cohomology basis is integrated along a straight line using a version
        of the double exponential quadrature. This method of integrating the
        cohomology basis is especially useful when integrating out to infinity,
        or near roots of ``self._dfdw``. In order to aid with convergence of the
        method, two main modification to a standard integrator are made, most
        importantly of which is the truncation of the integral near branch points,
        where the first term in the Puiseux series of the integrands are used to
        approximately bound the integral. The ``cutoff_individually`` parameter
        allows the user to set whether that truncation is uniform over all the
        integrands, which improves the complexity of the algorithm, but loses
        the ability to gain benefits where integrands vanish to a high order at
        the branchpoint.

        INPUT:

        - ``upstairs_edge`` -- tuple. A tuple of complex numbers of the form
          ``((z_start, w_start), z_end)`` specifying the path to integrate
          along, where ``z_start`` may be infinite, in which case ``w_start``
          must be an integer specifying the branch.

        - ``cutoff_individually`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          truncate the integrand uniformly or not. If ``None``, then no
          truncation is applied

        - ``raise_errors`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); by default the code
          uses convergence errors to ensure any answers returned are accurate.
          This can be turned off to return answers faster that are not
          necessarily correct.

        Return the Abel-Jacobi map to ``P`` from ``self._basepoint``.

        Computes a representative of the Abel-Jacobi map from ``self._basepoint``
        to ``P`` via a well-chosen vertex ``V``. The representative given will be
        dependent on the path chosen.

        INPUT:

        - ``P`` -- tuple. A pair giving the endpoint of the integral, either in
          the form ``(z, w)`` or ``(Infinity, branch)``, where in the latter case
          we are using the convention that the `w` value over `\infty` is given by
          the limit as ``z`` tends to `\infty` of ``self.w_values(z)[branch]``.

        OUTPUT: a vector of length ``self.genus``

        EXAMPLES:

        As the output of ``_aj_based`` is difficult to interpret due to its path
        dependency, we look at the output of :meth:`abel_jacobi`. We check for
        two hyperelliptic curves that the Abel-Jacobi map between two branch
        points is a 2-torsion point over the lattice. Note we must remember to
        reduce over the period lattice, as results are path dependent::

        Reduce a vector over the period lattice.

        Given a vector of length ``self.genus``, this method returns a vector
        in the same orbit of the period lattice that is short. There are two
        possible methods, ``'svp'`` which returns a certified shortest vector,
        but can be much slower for higher genus curves, and ``'ip'``, which is
        faster but not guaranteed to return the shortest vector. In general the
        latter will perform well when the lattice basis vectors are of similar
        size.

        INPUT:

        - ``vector`` -- vector. A vector of length ``self.genus`` to reduce over
          the lattice

        - ``method`` -- string (default: ``'ip'``) specifying the method
          to use to reduce the vector; the options are ``'ip'`` and ``'svp'``

        - ``b`` -- integer (default provided); as for
          :meth:`homomorphism_basis`, and used in its invocation if
          (re)calculating said basis

        - ``r`` -- integer (default: ``b/4``);  as for
          :meth:`homomorphism_basis`, and used in its invocation if
          (re)calculating said basis

        - ``normalised`` -- logical (default: ``False``); whether to use the
          period matrix with the differentials normalised s.t. the `A`-matrix
          is the identity.

        OUTPUT:

        Complex vector of length ``self.genus`` in the same orbit as ``vector``

def integer_matrix_relations(M1, M2, b=None, r=None):

    Determine integer relations between complex matrices.

    Given two square matrices with complex entries of size `g`, `h` respectively,
    numerically determine an (approximate) `\ZZ`-basis for the `2g \times 2h` matrices
    with integer entries of the shape `(D, B; C, A)` such that `B+M_1*A=(D+M_1*C)*M2`.
    By considering real and imaginary parts separately we obtain `2gh` equations
    with real coefficients in `4gh` variables. We scale the coefficients by a
    constant `2^b` and round them to integers, in order to obtain an integer
    system of equations. Standard application of LLL allows us to determine near
    solutions.

    The user can specify the parameter `b`, but by default the system will
    choose a `b` based on the size of the coefficients and the precision with
    which they are given.

    INPUT:

    - ``M1`` -- square complex valued matrix

    - ``M2`` -- square complex valued matrix of same size as ``M1``

    - ``b`` -- integer (default provided); the equation coefficients are scaled
      by `2^b` before rounding to integers

    - ``r`` -- integer (default: ``b/4``); the vectors found by LLL that satisfy
      the scaled equations to within `2^r` are reported as solutions

    OUTPUT:

    A list of `2g \times 2h` integer matrices that, for large enough `r`, `b-r`,
    generate the `\ZZ`-module of relevant transformations.
