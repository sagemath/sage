Homsets and endomorphism rings of elliptic curves

The set of homomorphisms between two elliptic curves (:class:`EllipticCurveHom`)
forms an abelian group under addition. Moreover, if the two curves are the same,
it even forms a (not always commutative) ring under composition.

This module encapsulates the set of homomorphisms between two given elliptic
curves as a Sage object.

.. NOTE::

    Currently only little nontrivial functionality is available, but this will
    hopefully change in the future.

EXAMPLES:

The only useful thing this class does at the moment is coercing integers into
the endomorphism ring as scalar multiplications::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,5])
    sage: f = End(E)(7); f
    Scalar-multiplication endomorphism [7] of Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + 3*y = x^3 + 2*x^2 + 4*x + 5 over Rational Field
    sage: f == E.scalar_multiplication(7)
    True

::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(431^2), [0,1])
    sage: E.automorphisms()[0] == 1
    True
    sage: E.automorphisms()[1] == -1
    True
    sage: omega = E.automorphisms()[2]
    sage: omega == 1
    False
    sage: omega^3 == 1
    True
    sage: (1 + omega + omega^2) == 0
    True
    sage: (2*omega + 1)^2 == -3
    True
