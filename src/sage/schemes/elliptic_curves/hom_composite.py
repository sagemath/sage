Composite morphisms of elliptic curves

It is often computationally convenient (for example, in cryptography)
to factor an isogeny of large degree into a composition of isogenies
of smaller (prime) degree. This class implements such a decomposition
while exposing (close to) the same interface as "normal", unfactored
elliptic-curve isogenies.

EXAMPLES:

The following example would take quite literally forever with the
straightforward :class:`EllipticCurveIsogeny` implementation, but
decomposing into prime steps is exponentially faster::

    sage: # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
    sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.hom_composite import EllipticCurveHom_composite
    sage: p = 3 * 2^143 - 1
    sage: GF(p^2).inject_variables()
    Defining z2
    sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(p^2), [1,0])
    sage: P = E.lift_x(31415926535897932384626433832795028841971 - z2)
    sage: P.order().factor()
    2^143
    sage: EllipticCurveHom_composite(E, P)
    Composite morphism of degree 11150372599265311570767859136324180752990208 = 2^143:
      From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x
            over Finite Field in z2 of size 33451117797795934712303577408972542258970623^2
      To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (18676616716352953484576727486205473216172067*z2+32690199585974925193292786311814241821808308)*x
            + (3369702436351367403910078877591946300201903*z2+15227558615699041241851978605002704626689722)

Yet, the interface provided by :class:`EllipticCurveHom_composite`
is identical to :class:`EllipticCurveIsogeny` and other instantiations
of :class:`EllipticCurveHom`::

    sage: # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
    sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(419), [0,1])
    sage: P = E.lift_x(33); P.order()
    35
    sage: psi = EllipticCurveHom_composite(E, P); psi
    Composite morphism of degree 35 = 5*7:
      From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1 over Finite Field of size 419
      To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 101*x + 285 over Finite Field of size 419
    sage: psi(E.lift_x(11))
    (352 : 346 : 1)
    sage: psi.rational_maps()
    ((x^35 + 162*x^34 + 186*x^33 + 92*x^32 - ... + 44*x^3 + 190*x^2 + 80*x
      - 72)/(x^34 + 162*x^33 - 129*x^32 + 41*x^31 + ... + 66*x^3 - 191*x^2 + 119*x + 21),
     (x^51*y - 176*x^50*y + 115*x^49*y - 120*x^48*y + ... + 72*x^3*y + 129*x^2*y + 163*x*y
      + 178*y)/(x^51 - 176*x^50 + 11*x^49 + 26*x^48 - ... - 77*x^3 + 185*x^2 + 169*x - 128))
    sage: psi.kernel_polynomial()
    x^17 + 81*x^16 + 7*x^15 + 82*x^14 + 49*x^13 + 68*x^12 + 109*x^11 + 326*x^10
     + 117*x^9 + 136*x^8 + 111*x^7 + 292*x^6 + 55*x^5 + 389*x^4 + 175*x^3 + 43*x^2 + 149*x + 373
    sage: psi.dual()
    Composite morphism of degree 35 = 7*5:
      From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 101*x + 285 over Finite Field of size 419
      To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1 over Finite Field of size 419
    sage: psi.formal()
    t + 211*t^5 + 417*t^7 + 159*t^9 + 360*t^11 + 259*t^13 + 224*t^15 + 296*t^17 + 139*t^19 + 222*t^21 + O(t^23)

Equality is decided correctly (and, in some cases, much faster than
comparing :meth:`EllipticCurveHom.rational_maps`) even when distinct
factorizations of the same isogeny are compared::

    sage: psi == EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, P)                                             # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
    True

We can easily obtain the individual factors of the composite map::

    sage: psi.factors()                                                                 # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
    (Isogeny of degree 5
      from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1 over Finite Field of size 419
        to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 140*x + 214 over Finite Field of size 419,
     Isogeny of degree 7
      from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 140*x + 214 over Finite Field of size 419
        to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 101*x + 285 over Finite Field of size 419)

    r"""
    This method takes a point `P` of order `\ell^n` and returns
    a sequence of degree-`\ell` isogenies whose composition has
    the subgroup generated by `P` as its kernel.

    The optional argument ``split``, a real number between
    `0` and `1`, controls the *strategy* used to compute the
    isogeny: In general, the algorithm performs a number of
    scalar multiplications `[\ell]` and a number of
    `\ell`-isogeny evaluations, and there exist tradeoffs
    between them.

    - Setting ``split`` to `0` skews the algorithm towards
      isogenies, minimizing multiplications.
      The asymptotic complexity is `O(n \log(\ell) + n^2 \ell)`.

    - Setting ``split`` to `1` skews the algorithm towards
      multiplications, minimizing isogenies.
      The asymptotic complexity is `O(n^2 \log(\ell) + n \ell)`.

    - Values strictly between `0` and `1` define *sparse*
      strategies, which balance the number of isogenies and
      multiplications according to the parameter.
      The asymptotic complexity is `O(n \log(n) \ell)`.

    The optional parameter ``velu_sqrt_bound`` prescribes the
    point in which the computation of a single isogeny should be
    performed using square root Velu instead of simple Velu.

    .. NOTE::

        As of July 2022, good values for ``split`` range somewhere
        between roughly `0.6` and `0.9`, depending on the size of
        `\ell` and the cost of base-field arithmetic.

    REFERENCES:

    Sparse strategies were introduced in [DJP2014]_, §4.2.2.

    ALGORITHM:

    The splitting rule implemented here is a simple heuristic which
    is usually not optimal. The advantage is that it does not rely
    on prior knowledge of degrees and exact costs of elliptic-curve
    arithmetic, while still working reasonably well for a fairly
    wide range of situations.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
        sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves import hom_composite
        sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(8191), [1,0])
        sage: P = E.random_point()
        sage: (l,n), = P.order().factor()

        (0 : 1 : 0)
        sage: [phi.degree() for phi in phis] == [l]*n
        True

    All choices of ``split`` produce the same result, albeit
    not equally fast::

        sage: # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
        sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(2^127 - 1), [1,0])
