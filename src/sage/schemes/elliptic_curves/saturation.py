Saturation of Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over number fields

Points `P_1`, `\dots`, `P_r` in `E(K)`, where `E` is an elliptic curve
over a number field `K`, are said to be `p`-saturated if no linear
combination `\sum n_iP_i` is divisible by `p` in `E(K)` except
trivially when all `n_i` are multiples of `p`.  The points are said to
be saturated if they are `p`-saturated at all primes; this is always
true for all but finitely many primes since `E(K)` is a
finitely-generated Abelian group.

The process of `p`-saturating a given set of points is implemented
here.  The naive algorithm simply checks all `(p^r-1)/(p-1)`
projective combinations of the points, testing each to see if it can
be divided by `p`.  If this occurs then we replace one of the points
and continue.  The function :meth:`p_saturation` does one step of
this, while :meth:`full_p_saturation` repeats until the points are
`p`-saturated.  A more sophisticated algorithm for `p`-saturation is
implemented which is much more efficient for large `p` and `r`, and
involves computing the reduction of the points modulo auxiliary primes
to obtain linear conditions modulo `p` which must be satisfied by the
coefficients `a_i` of any nontrivial relation.  When the points are
already `p`-saturated this sieving technique can prove their
saturation quickly.

The method :meth:`saturation` of the class :class:`EllipticCurve_number_field`
applies full `p`-saturation at any given set of primes, or can compute
a bound on the primes `p` at which the given points may not be
`p`-saturated.  This involves computing a lower bound for the
canonical height of points of infinite order, together with estimates
from the geometry of numbers.

def reduce_mod_q(x, amodq):

def p_projections(Eq, Plist, p, debug=False):
    r"""

    INPUT:

    - ``Eq`` -- an elliptic curve over a finite field

    - ``Plist`` -- list of points on `Eq`

    - ``p`` -- a prime number

    OUTPUT:

    A list of `r\le2` vectors in `\GF{p^n}`, the images of the points in
    `G \otimes \GF{p}`, where `r` is the number of vectors is the
    `p`-rank of `Eq`.

    ALGORITHM:

    First project onto the `p`-primary part of `Eq`.  If that has
    `p`-rank 1 (i.e. is cyclic), use discrete logs there to define a
    map to `\GF{p}`, otherwise use the Weil pairing to define two
    independent maps to `\GF{p}`.

    EXAMPLES:

    This curve has three independent rational points::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-7,6])

    We reduce modulo `409` where its order is `3^2\cdot7^2`; the
    `3`-primary part is non-cyclic while the `7`-primary part is
    cyclic of order `49`::

        sage: F = GF(409)
        sage: EF = E.change_ring(F)
        sage: G = EF.abelian_group()
        sage: G
        Additive abelian group isomorphic to Z/147 + Z/3
         embedded in Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve
          defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + 402*x + 6 over Finite Field of size 409
        sage: G.order().factor()
        3^2 * 7^2

    We construct three points and project them to the `p`-primary
    parts for `p=2,3,5,7`, yielding 0,2,0,1 vectors of length 3 modulo
    `p` respectively.  The exact vectors output depend on the computed
    generators of `G`::
