Scheme implementation overview

Various parts of schemes were implemented by different authors. This document
aims to give an overview of the different classes of schemes working together
coherently.

Generic
-------

- **Scheme:**
  A scheme whose datatype might not be defined in terms of algebraic equations:
  e.g. the Jacobian of a curve may be represented by means of a Scheme.

- **AlgebraicScheme:**
  A scheme defined by means of polynomial equations, which may be reducible or
  defined over a ring other than a field.  In particular, the defining ideal
  need not be a radical ideal, and an algebraic scheme may be defined over
  `\mathrm{Spec}(R)`.

- **AmbientSpaces:**
  Most effective models of algebraic scheme will be defined not by generic
  gluings, but by embeddings in some fixed ambient space.

Ambients
--------

- **AffineSpace:**
  Affine spaces and their affine subschemes form the most important universal
  objects from which algebraic schemes are built.  The affine spaces form
  universal objects in the sense that a morphism is uniquely determined by the
  images of its coordinate functions and any such images determine a
  well-defined morphism.

  By default affine spaces will embed in some ordinary projective space, unless
  it is created as an affine patch of another object.

- **ProjectiveSpace:**
  Projective spaces are the most natural ambient spaces for most projective
  objects.  They are locally universal objects.

- **ProjectiveSpace_ordinary (not implemented):**
  The ordinary projective spaces have the standard weights `[1,..,1]` on their
  coefficients.

- **ProjectiveSpace_weighted (not implemented):**
  A special subtype for non-standard weights.

- **ToricVariety:**
  Toric varieties are (partial) compactifications of algebraic tori `(\CC^*)^n`
  compatible with torus action. Affine and projective spaces are examples of
  toric varieties, but it is not envisioned that these special cases should
  inherit from :class:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety.ToricVariety`.

Subschemes
----------

- **AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_affine:**
  An algebraic scheme defined by means of an embedding in a
  fixed ambient affine space.

- **AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective:**
  An algebraic scheme defined by means of an embedding in a fixed ambient
  projective space.

- **QuasiAffineScheme (not yet implemented):**
  An open subset `U = X \setminus Z` of a closed subset `X` of affine space;
  note that this is mathematically a quasi-projective scheme, but its
  ambient space is an affine space and its points are represented by
  affine rather than projective points.

  .. NOTE::

    AlgebraicScheme_quasi is implemented, as a base class for this.

- **QuasiProjectiveScheme (not yet implemented):**
  An open subset of a closed subset of projective space; this datatype
  stores the defining polynomial, polynomials, or ideal defining the
  projective closure `X` plus the closed subscheme `Z` of `X` whose complement
  `U = X \setminus Z` is the quasi-projective scheme.

  .. NOTE::

    The quasi-affine and quasi-projective datatype lets one create schemes
    like the multiplicative group scheme
    `\mathbb{G}_m = \mathbb{A}^1\setminus \{(0)\}`
    and the non-affine scheme `\mathbb{A}^2\setminus \{(0,0)\}`.  The latter
    is not affine and is not of the form `\mathrm{Spec}(R)`.

Point sets
----------

- **PointSets and points over a ring (to do):**
  For algebraic schemes `X/S` and `T/S` over `S`, one can form the point set
  `X(T)` of morphisms from `T\to X` over `S`.

  A projective space object in the category of schemes is a locally free object
  -- the images of the generator functions *locally* determine a point.  Over a
  field, one can choose one of the standard affine patches by the condition
  that a coordinate function `X_i \ne 0`.

  ::

        sage: PP.<X,Y,Z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
        sage: PP
        Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
        sage: PP(QQ)
        Set of rational points of Projective Space
        of dimension 2 over Rational Field
        sage: PP(QQ)([-2, 3, 5])
        (-2/5 : 3/5 : 1)

  Over a ring, this is not true anymore. For example, even over an integral
  domain which is not a PID, there may be no *single* affine patch which covers
  a point.

  ::

        sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
        sage: S.<t> = R.quo(x^2 + 5)
        sage: P.<X,Y,Z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, S)
        sage: P(S)
        Set of rational points of Projective Space of dimension 2 over
        Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring with
        modulus x^2 + 5

  In order to represent the projective point `(2:1+t) = (1-t:3)` we note that
  the first representative is not well-defined at the prime `p = (2,1+t)` and
  the second element is not well-defined at the prime `q = (1-t,3)`, but that
  `p + q = (1)`, so globally the pair of coordinate representatives is
  well-defined.

  ::

        sage: P([2, 1 + t])
        (2 : t + 1 : 1)

  In fact, we need a test ``R.ideal([2, 1 + t]) == R.ideal([1])`` in order to make
  this meaningful.

Berkovich Analytic Spaces
-------------------------

- **Berkovich Analytic Space (not yet implemented)**
  The construction of analytic spaces from schemes due to Berkovich. Any Berkovich
  space should inherit from :class:`Berkovich`

- **Berkovich Analytic Space over Cp**
  A special case of the general Berkovich analytic space construction.
  Affine Berkovich space over `\CC_p` is the set of seminorms on the polynomial
  ring `\CC_p[x]`, while projective Berkovich space over `\CC_p` is the one-point compactification
  of affine Berkovich space `\CC_p`. Points are represented using the classification (due
  to Berkovich) of a corresponding decreasing sequence of disks in `\CC_p`.
