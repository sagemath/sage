cdef class ECModularSymbol:
    r"""
    Modular symbol associated with an elliptic curve,  using John Cremona's newforms class.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.libs.eclib.newforms import ECModularSymbol
        sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
        sage: M = ECModularSymbol(E,1); M
        Modular symbol with sign 1 over Rational Field attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field

    By default, symbols are based at the cusp `\infty`, i.e. we evaluate `\{\infty,r\}`::

        sage: [M(1/i) for i in range(1,11)]
        [2/5, -8/5, -3/5, 7/5, 12/5, 12/5, 7/5, -3/5, -8/5, 2/5]

    We can also switch the base point to the cusp `0`::

        sage: [M(1/i, base_at_infinity=False) for i in range(1,11)]
        [0, -2, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1, -2, 0]

    For the minus symbols this makes no difference since
    `\{0,\infty\}` is in the plus space.  Note that to evaluate minus
    symbols the space must be defined with sign 0, which makes both
    signs available::

        sage: M = ECModularSymbol(E,0); M
        Modular symbol with sign 0 over Rational Field attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
        sage: [M(1/i, -1) for i in range(1,11)]
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0]
        sage: [M(1/i, -1, base_at_infinity=False) for i in range(1,11)]
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0]

    If the ECModularSymbol is created with sign 0 then as well as
    asking for both + and - symbols, we can also obtain both (as a
    tuple).  However it is more work to create the full modular
    symbol space::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
        sage: M = ECModularSymbol(E,0); M
        Modular symbol with sign 0 over Rational Field attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
        sage: [M(1/i) for i in range(2,11)]
        [[-8/5, 0],
         [-3/5, 1],
         [7/5, 1],
         [12/5, 0],
         [12/5, 0],
         [7/5, -1],
         [-3/5, -1],
         [-8/5, 0],
         [2/5, 0]]

    The curve is automatically converted to its minimal model::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1/4])
        sage: ECModularSymbol(E)
        Modular symbol with sign 1 over Rational Field attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 over Rational Field

    Non-optimal curves are handled correctly in eclib, by comparing the ratios of real and/or imaginary periods::

        sage: from sage.libs.eclib.newforms import ECModularSymbol
        sage: E1 = EllipticCurve('11a1') # optimal
        sage: E1.period_lattice().basis()
        (1.26920930427955, 0.634604652139777 + 1.45881661693850*I)
        sage: M1 = ECModularSymbol(E1,0)
        sage: M1(0)
        [2/5, 0]
        sage: M1(1/3)
        [-3/5, 1]

    One non-optimal curve has real period 1/5 that of the optimal one, so plus symbols scale up by a factor of 5 while minus symbols are unchanged::

        sage: E2 = EllipticCurve('11a2') # not optimal
        sage: E2.period_lattice().basis()
        (0.253841860855911, 0.126920930427955 + 1.45881661693850*I)
        sage: M2 = ECModularSymbol(E2,0)
        sage: M2(0)
        [2, 0]
        sage: M2(1/3)
        [-3, 1]
        sage: all((M2(r,1)==5*M1(r,1)) for r in QQ.range_by_height(10))
        True
        sage: all((M2(r,-1)==M1(r,-1)) for r in QQ.range_by_height(10))
        True

    The other non-optimal curve has real period 5 times that of the optimal one, so plus symbols scale down by a factor of 5; again, minus symbols are unchanged::

        sage: E3 = EllipticCurve('11a3') # not optimal
        sage: E3.period_lattice().basis()
        (6.34604652139777, 3.17302326069888 + 1.45881661693850*I)
        sage: M3 = ECModularSymbol(E3,0)
        sage: M3(0)
        [2/25, 0]
        sage: M3(1/3)
        [-3/25, 1]
        sage: all((5*M3(r,1)==M1(r,1)) for r in QQ.range_by_height(10))
        True
        sage: all((M3(r,-1)==M1(r,-1)) for r in QQ.range_by_height(10))
        True

    TESTS::

        Construct the modular symbol object from an elliptic curve.

        INPUT:

        - ``E``- an elliptic curve defined over Q.

        - ``sign`` -- integer; 0 or +1.  If +1, only plus modular symbols
         of this sign are available.  If 0, modular symbols of both
         signs are available but the construction is more expensive.

        - ``nap`` -- integer (default: 1000); the number of ap of E to use
         in determining the normalisation of the modular symbols.
         Note that eclib will increase this to 100*sqrt(N) if necessary.

        INPUT:

        - ``r`` -- rational; a rational number

        - ``sign`` -- integer; either +1, -1 or 0.  If the sign of the
          space is +1, only sign +1 is allowed.  Default: ``self.sign``, or +1

        OUTPUT:

        If sign=+1, the rational value of the plus modular symbol is

        symbol is returned.  If sign=0, a tuple of both the plus and
