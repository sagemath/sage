    Controls the default proof strategy for integer arithmetic algorithms

    INPUT:

    - ``t`` -- boolean or ``None``

    OUTPUT:

    If t is ``True``, requires integer arithmetic operations to (by
    default) return results that are true unconditionally: the
    correctness will not depend on an algorithm with a nonzero
    probability of returning an incorrect answer or on the truth of
    any unproven conjectures.

    If t is ``False``, allows integer arithmetic operations to (by
    default) return results that may depend on unproven conjectures or
    on probabilistic algorithms.  Such algorithms often have a
    substantial speed improvement over those requiring proof.

    If t is ``None``, returns the integer arithmetic proof status.
