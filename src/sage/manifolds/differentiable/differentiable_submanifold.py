Submanifolds of differentiable manifolds

Given two differentiable manifolds `N` and `M`, an *immersion* `\phi` is a
differentiable map `N\to M` whose differential is everywhere
injective. One then says that `N` is an *immersed submanifold* of `M`, via
`\phi`.

If in addition, `\phi` is a differentiable embedding (i.e. `\phi` is an
immersion that is a homeomorphism onto its image), then `N` is called an
*embedded submanifold* of `M` (or simply a *submanifold*).

`\phi` can also depend on one or multiple parameters. As long as the
differential of `\phi` remains injective in these parameters, it represents a
*foliation*. The *dimension* of the foliation is defined as the number of
parameters.

    Submanifold of a differentiable manifold.

    Given two differentiable manifolds `N` and `M`, an *immersion* `\phi` is a
    differentiable map `N\to M` whose differential is everywhere
    injective. One then says that `N` is an *immersed submanifold* of `M`, via
    `\phi`.

    If in addition, `\phi` is a differentiable embedding (i.e. `\phi` is an
    immersion that is a homeomorphism onto its image), then `N` is called an
    *embedded submanifold* of `M` (or simply a *submanifold*).

    `\phi` can also depend on one or multiple parameters. As long as the
    differential of `\phi` remains injective in these parameters, it represents
    a *foliation*. The *dimension* of the foliation is defined as the number of
    parameters.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- positive integer; dimension of the submanifold
    - ``name`` -- string; name (symbol) given to the submanifold
    - ``field`` -- field `K` on which the sub manifold is defined; allowed
      values are

      - ``'real'`` or an object of type ``RealField`` (e.g., ``RR``) for
        a manifold over `\RR`
      - ``'complex'`` or an object of type ``ComplexField`` (e.g., ``CC``)
        for a manifold over `\CC`
      - an object in the category of topological fields (see
        :class:`~sage.categories.fields.Fields` and
        :class:`~sage.categories.topological_spaces.TopologicalSpaces`)
        for other types of manifolds

    - ``structure`` -- manifold structure (see
      :class:`~sage.manifolds.structure.TopologicalStructure` or
      :class:`~sage.manifolds.structure.RealTopologicalStructure`)
    - ``ambient`` -- (default: ``None``) codomain `M` of the immersion `\phi`;
      must be a differentiable manifold. If ``None``, it is set to ``self``
    - ``base_manifold`` -- (default: ``None``) if not ``None``, must be a
      differentiable manifold; the created object is then an open subset of
      ``base_manifold``
    - ``diff_degree`` -- (default: ``infinity``) degree of differentiability
    - ``latex_name`` -- (default: ``None``) string; LaTeX symbol to
      denote the submanifold; if none are provided, it is set to ``name``
    - ``start_index`` -- (default: 0) integer; lower value of the range of
      indices used for "indexed objects" on the submanifold, e.g., coordinates
      in a chart
    - ``category`` -- (default: ``None``) to specify the category; if ``None``,
      ``Manifolds(field).Differentiable()`` (or ``Manifolds(field).Smooth()``
      if ``diff_degree`` = ``infinity``) is assumed (see the category
      :class:`~sage.categories.manifolds.Manifolds`)
    - ``unique_tag`` -- (default: ``None``) tag used to force the construction
      of a new object when all the other arguments have been used previously
      (without ``unique_tag``, the
      :class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation`
      behavior inherited from
      :class:`~sage.manifolds.subset.ManifoldSubset` via
      :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold`
      would return the previously constructed object corresponding to these
      arguments)

    EXAMPLES:

    Let `N` be a 2-dimensional submanifold of a 3-dimensional manifold `M`::

        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
        sage: N = Manifold(2, 'N', ambient=M)
        sage: N
        2-dimensional differentiable submanifold N immersed in the
         3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
        sage: CM.<x,y,z> = M.chart()
        sage: CN.<u,v> = N.chart()

    Let us define a 1-dimensional foliation indexed by `t`::

        sage: t = var('t')
        sage: phi = N.continuous_map(M, {(CN,CM): [u, v, t+u^2+v^2]})
        sage: phi.display()
        N → M
           (u, v) ↦ (x, y, z) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2 + t)

    The foliation inverse maps are needed for computing the adapted chart on
    the ambient manifold::

        sage: phi_inv = M.continuous_map(N, {(CM, CN): [x, y]})
        sage: phi_inv.display()
        M → N
           (x, y, z) ↦ (u, v) = (x, y)
        sage: phi_inv_t = M.scalar_field({CM: z-x^2-y^2})
        sage: phi_inv_t.display()
        M → ℝ
           (x, y, z) ↦ -x^2 - y^2 + z

    `\phi` can then be declared as an embedding `N\to M`::

        sage: N.set_embedding(phi, inverse=phi_inv, var=t,
        ....:                 t_inverse={t: phi_inv_t})

    The foliation can also be used to find new charts on the ambient manifold
    that are adapted to the foliation, ie in which the expression of the
    immersion is trivial. At the same time, the appropriate coordinate changes
    are computed::

        sage: N.adapted_chart()
        [Chart (M, (u_M, v_M, t_M))]
        sage: M.atlas()
        [Chart (M, (x, y, z)), Chart (M, (u_M, v_M, t_M))]
        sage: len(M.coord_changes())
        2
