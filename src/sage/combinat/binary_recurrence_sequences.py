Binary Recurrence Sequences

This class implements several methods relating to general linear binary
recurrence sequences, including a sieve to find perfect powers in integral
linear binary recurrence sequences.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: R(137)        #the 137th term of the Fibonacci sequence
    19134702400093278081449423917

    sage: [R(i) % 4 for i in range(12)]
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
    sage: R.period(4)        #the period of the fibonacci sequence modulo 4
    6
    sage: R.pthpowers(2, 10**10)        # long time (7 seconds) -- in fact these are all squares, c.f. [BMS06]
    [0, 1, 2, 12]

    sage: S = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(8,1)  #a Lucas sequence

        `b = u_1-u_0\\alpha/(\\beta - \\alpha)`.  The sequence is, thus, given by
        `u_n = a \\alpha^n - b\\beta^n`.  Then we say that the sequence is nondegenerate
        if and only if `a*b*\\alpha*\\beta \\neq 0` and `\\alpha/\\beta` is not a
        root of unity.

        More concretely, there are 4 classes of degeneracy, that can all be formulated
        in terms of the matrix `F = [[0,1], [c, b]]`.

        - `F` is singular -- this corresponds to ``c`` = 0, and thus
          `\\alpha*\\beta = 0`. This sequence is geometric after term ``u0``
          and so we call it ``quasigeometric``

        - `v = [[u_0], [u_1]]` is an eigenvector of `F` -- this corresponds to
          a ``geometric`` sequence with `a*b = 0`

        - `F` is nondiagonalizable -- this corresponds to `\\alpha = \\beta`.
          This sequence will be the point-wise product of an arithmetic and
          geometric sequence.

        - `F^k` is scalar, for some `k>1` -- this corresponds to
          `\\alpha/\\beta` a `k` th root of unity. This sequence is a union of
          several geometric sequences, and so we again call it ``quasigeometric``.

        Find the indices of proveably all `p`-th powers in the recurrence sequence
        bounded by Bound.

        Let `u_n` be a binary recurrence sequence.  A ``p`` th power in `u_n`
        is a solution to `u_n = y^p` for some integer `y`.  There are only
        finitely many ``p`` th powers in any recurrence sequence [SS1983]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``p`` -- a rational prime integer (the fixed p in `u_n = y^p`)

        - ``Bound`` -- a natural number (the maximum index `n` in `u_n = y^p` that is checked)

        OUTPUT:

        A list of the indices of all ``p`` th powers less bounded by
        ``Bound``. If the sequence is degenerate and there are many
        ``p`` th powers, raises :exc:`ValueError`.
