Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm

The Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm generates all permutations of a list in
an order such that each permutation is obtained by transposing two adjacent
elements from the previous permutation.

Each element of the list has a direction (initialized at -1) that
changes at each permutation and that is used to determine which
elements to transpose. Thus in addition to the permutation itself, the
direction of each element is also stored.

Note that the permutations are not generated in lexicographic order.

class SJT(CombinatorialElement):
    r"""
    A representation of a list permuted using the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter
    algorithm.

    Each element of the list has a direction (initialized at -1) that changes at
    each permutation and that is used to determine which elements to transpose.
    The directions have three possible values:

    - ``-1``: element tranposes to the left

    - ``1``: element transposes to the right

    - ``0``: element does not move

    Thus in addition to the permutation itself, the direction of each element is
    also stored.

    Note that the permutations are not generated in lexicographic order.

    .. WARNING::

        An ``SJT`` object should always be created with identity permutation for
        the algorithm to behave properly. If the identity permutation is not
        provided, it expects a coherent list of directions according to the
        provided input. This list is not checked.

    .. TODO::

        Implement the previous permutation for the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter
        algorithm.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.combinat.SJT import SJT
        sage: s = SJT([1, 2, 3, 4]); s
        [1, 2, 3, 4]
        sage: s = s.next(); s
        [1, 2, 4, 3]
        sage: p = Permutation(s._list, algorithm='sjt', sjt=s)
        sage: p

        Transpose two elements at positions ``a`` and ``b`` in ``perm`` and
        their corresponding directions as well following the
        Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm.

        Each permutation is obtained by transposing two adjacent elements from
        the previous permutation.

        INPUT:

        - ``l`` -- list; a list of ordered ``int``.

        - ``directions`` -- list (default: ``None``); a list of directions for
          each element in the permuted list. Used when constructing permutations
          from a pre-defined internal state.
