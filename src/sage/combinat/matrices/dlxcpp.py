    Solve the Exact Cover problem by using the Dancing Links algorithm
    described by Knuth.

    Consider a matrix M with entries of 0 and 1, and compute a subset
    of the rows of this matrix which sum to the vector of all 1s.

    The dancing links algorithm works particularly well for sparse
    matrices, so the input is a list of lists of the form::

       [
        [i_11,i_12,...,i_1r]
        ...
        [i_m1,i_m2,...,i_ms]
       ]

    where M[j][i_jk] = 1.

    The first example below corresponds to the matrix::

       1110
       1010
       0100
       0001

    which is exactly covered by::

       1110
       0001

    and

    ::

       1010
       0100
       0001

    If soln is a solution given by DLXCPP(rows) then

    [ rows[soln[0]], rows[soln[1]], ... rows[soln[len(soln)-1]] ]

    is an exact cover.

    Solutions are given as a list.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: rows = [[0,1,2]]
        sage: rows+= [[0,2]]
        sage: rows+= [[1]]
        sage: rows+= [[3]]
        sage: [x for x in DLXCPP(rows)]
        [[3, 0], [3, 1, 2]]
