# Heavily Modified Feb 2008, Tom Boothby
#  * Added a function which takes a Sage matrix and solves
#    the exact cover problem for it.
#  * Recursive search is now iterative
#  * Removed callback functionality
#  * Revamped the class to be a pythonic generator; new usage:
#        for cover in DLXMatrix(ones, initialsolution):
#            blah(cover)
#  * DOCUMENTATION AND TESTS GALORE HOLYCRAP 100% COVERAGE!

# DLXMatrix class is used to store and solve an exact cover problem
# with help of Dancing Links [1] technique by Donald Knuth. The
# problem can be stated as an attempt to leave out rows of a 0/1
# matrix until remaining matrix has exactly one 1 in each column.
# Knuth proposes a fast solution technique based on clever trick with
# double linked list.
#
# This implementation will return row numbers of the solution instead
# column indexes (like in the Knuth's paper).

        Solve the Exact Cover problem by using the Dancing Links algorithm
        described by Knuth.

        Consider a matrix M with entries of 0 and 1, and compute a subset
        of the rows of this matrix which sum to the vector of all 1s.

        The dancing links algorithm works particularly well for sparse
        matrices, so the input is a list of lists of the form: (note the
        1-index!)::

          [
           [1, [i_11,i_12,...,i_1r]]
           ...
           [m,[i_m1,i_m2,...,i_ms]]
          ]

        where M[j][i_jk] = 1.

        The first example below corresponds to the matrix::

           1110
           1010
           0100
           0001

        which is exactly covered by::

           1110
           0001

        and

        ::

           1010
           0100
           0001

        EXAMPLES::

        .. NOTE::

            The 0 entry is reserved internally for headers in the
            sparse representation, so rows and columns begin their
            indexing with 1.  Apologies for any heartache this
            causes. Blame the original author, or fix it yourself.
