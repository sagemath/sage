"""
Permutations (Cython file)

This is a nearly-straightforward implementation of what
Knuth calls "Algorithm P" in TAOCP 7.2.1.2.  The intent is
to be able to enumerate permutation by "plain changes", or
multiplication by adjacent transpositions, as a generator.
This is useful when a class of objects is inherently
enumerated by permutations, but it is faster to swap items
in a permutation than construct the next object directly
from the next permutation in a list. The backtracking
algorithm in sage/graphs/genus.pyx is an example of this.

The lowest level is implemented as a struct with auxiliary
methods.  This is because Cython does not allow pointers to
class instances, so a list of these objects is inherently
slower than a list of structs.  The author prefers ugly code
to slow code.

For those willing to sacrifice a (very small) amount of
speed, we provide a class that wraps our struct.

# The next two functions, reset_swap and next_swap do the
# real work.  They've been implemented separately because
# the target application in sage/graphs/genus.pyx is
# cleaner and faster if it can manage its own memory.
# Both take three arguments:
#
#    int  n: number of elements to permute
#    int *c: an int array of length at least n
#    int *o: an int array of length at least o
#
# The user is advised to call reset_swap before next_swap.
