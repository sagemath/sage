'''Statstical tests designed to be used in doctests.

Many SAGE functions that produce random elements do so with an implicit understanding that the elements are coming from
a certain distribution. For discrete objects, uniform sampling is often expected.

This module is intended to hold such statistical tests.

def sigmas_from_uniform(list_of_counts):
    '''Approximation for the likelihood of the observations given a uniform distribution. 

    Given $n$ possible outcomes and $k$ samples, the expected number of occurrences of each outcome is $k/n$.
    Let $x_i$ be the number of occurences for outcome $i$.

    For sufficiently large $k,n$:
    chi_square = $sum_i (x_i-k/n)**2/(k/n)$ is approximately distributed as a chi squared with $k-1$ degrees of freedom.
    sigmas = $(chi_square_stat-(k-1))/(2k-2)**.5$ is approximately distributed as Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. Sigma refers to standard deviation.

    Negative sigmas indicates that the counts are *more* uniform than you would expect at random.
    Positive sigmas indicates that the counts are *less* uniform than you would expect at random.
