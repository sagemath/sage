# sage.cpython is an ordinary package, not a namespace package.

# This package is imported very early, which is why workarounds/monkey-patching
# are done in this file.

# Monkey-patch ExtensionFileLoader to allow IPython to find the sources
# of Cython files. See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24681
