cdef class ContainChildren():
    """
    Context manager which will ensure that all forked child processes
    will be forced to exit if they try to exit the context.

    This can be used as a guard against race conditions, where a child
    process wants to ``fork`` and ``exec`` but it gets interrupted after
    the ``fork`` but before the ``exec``. In such situations, the child
    would raise ``KeyboardInterrupt`` and execute code which is really
    meant for the parent process.

    INPUT:

    - ``exitcode`` -- integer (default: 0); exit code to use when a
      child process tries to exit the with block normally (not due to
      an exception)

    - ``exceptcode`` -- integer (default: 1); exit code to use when a
      child process tries to exit the with block due to an exception

    - ``silent`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``False``, print
      exceptions raised by the child process

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.interfaces.process import ContainChildren
        sage: pid = os.getpid()
        sage: with ContainChildren():
        ....:     child = os.fork()
        sage: assert pid == os.getpid()  # We are the parent process

    By default, exceptions raised by the child process are printed::

        sage: with ContainChildren():
        ....:     child = os.fork()
        ....:     if child == 0:
        ....:         raise RuntimeError("Exception raised by child")
        ....:     _ = os.waitpid(child, 0r)
        Exception raised by child process with pid=...:
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        RuntimeError: Exception raised by child

    The same example with ``silent=True`` does not show the exception::

        sage: with ContainChildren(silent=True):
        ....:     child = os.fork()
        ....:     if child == 0:
        ....:         raise RuntimeError("Exception raised by child")
        ....:     _ = os.waitpid(child, 0r)

        The flushing solves the following double-output problem::

@contextmanager
def terminate(sp, interval=1, signals=[signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIGKILL]):
    r"""
    Context manager that terminates or kills the given `subprocess.Popen`
    when it is no longer needed, in case the process does not end on its
    own.

    Before sending signals, the standard I/O pipes are closed, which
    might cause the application to quit by itself.

    INPUT:

    - ``sp`` -- a `subprocess.Popen` instance
    - ``interval`` -- float (default: 1); interval in seconds between
      termination attempts
    - ``signals`` -- (list, default [signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIGKILL]) the
      signals to send the process in order to terminate it

    EXAMPLES:

    A still-running process will be terminated upon exiting the terminate
    context::

        sage: import signal, sys
        sage: from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
        sage: from sage.interfaces.process import terminate
        sage: cmd = [sys.executable, '-c', 'import sys; print("y")\n'
        ....:                              'sys.stdout.flush()\n'
        ....:                              'while True: pass']
        sage: sp = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE, encoding='ascii')
        sage: with terminate(sp, interval=0.2):
        ....:     print(sp.stdout.readline())
        y
        <BLANKLINE>
        sage: sp.wait() == -signal.SIGTERM
        True

    If for any reason the process can't be terminated normally, a ``kill()``
    is attempted::

        sage: cmd[2] = 'from signal import signal, SIGTERM, SIG_IGN\n' \
        ....:          'import sys\n' \
        ....:          'signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN)\n' \
        ....:          'print("y"); sys.stdout.flush()\n' \
        ....:          'while True: pass'
        sage: sp = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE, encoding='ascii')
        sage: with terminate(sp, interval=0.2):
        ....:     print(sp.stdout.readline())
        y
        <BLANKLINE>
        sage: sp.wait() == -signal.SIGKILL
        True

    If the process dies by itself, we don't need to wait too long::

        sage: cmd = [sys.executable, '-c', 'from time import sleep; sleep(0.5)']
        sage: t0 = walltime()
        sage: sp = Popen(cmd)
        sage: with terminate(sp, interval=5.0):
        ....:     pass
        sage: t = walltime() - t0
        sage: t <= 4.0 or t
        True

    If the process is already dead, nothing happens::

        sage: t0 = walltime()
        sage: with terminate(sp, interval=5.0):
        ....:     raise Exception("just testing")
        sage: t = walltime() - t0
        sage: t <= 4.0 or t
        True
