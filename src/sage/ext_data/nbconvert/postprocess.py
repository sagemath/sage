r"""
This postprocess script fixes some issues with .rst files returned by nbconvert:

- it fixes the rendering of the first title (that looks like markdown not rst)
- it removes the header that defines some LaTeX macros
- it removes the :math: role since this is the default one

AUTHORS:

- Thierry Monteil (2018): initial version.
