def jacobi(M):
    r"""
    Compute the upper-triangular part of the Cholesky/Jacobi
    decomposition of the symmetric matrix ``M``.

    Let `M` be a symmetric `n \times n`-matrix over a field `F`.
    Let `m_{i,j}` denote the `(i,j)`-th entry of `M` for any
    `1 \leq i \leq n` and `1 \leq j \leq n`. Then, the
    upper-triangular part computed by this method is the
    upper-triangular `n \times n`-matrix `Q` whose
    `(i,j)`-th entry `q_{i,j}` satisfies

    .. MATH::

        q_{i,j} =
        \begin{cases}
            \frac{1}{q_{i,i}} \left( m_{i,j} - \sum_{r<i} q_{r,r} q_{r,i} q_{r,j} \right) & i < j, \\
            m_{i,j} - \sum_{r<i} q_{r,r} q_{r,i}^2 & i = j, \\
            0 & i > j,
        \end{cases}

    for all `1 \leq i \leq n` and `1 \leq j \leq n`. (These
    equalities determine the entries of `Q` uniquely by
    recursion.) This matrix `Q` is defined for every invertible
    `n \times n`-matrix `M`. Its definition is taken from (2.3)
    of [FP1985]_.

    .. NOTE::

        This should be a method of matrices.

def diamond_cut(V, GM, C, verbose=False):
    r"""
    Perform diamond cutting on polyhedron ``V`` with basis matrix ``GM``
    and squared radius ``C``.

    INPUT:

    - ``V`` -- polyhedron to cut from

    - ``GM`` -- half of the basis matrix of the lattice

    - ``C`` -- square of the radius to use in cutting algorithm

    - ``verbose`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to print debug information

    OUTPUT: a :class:`Polyhedron` instance

    ALGORITHM:

    Use the algorithm in (2.8) of [FP1985]_ to iterate through the nonzero
    vectors ``hv`` of length at most `\sqrt{C}` in the lattice spanned by
    ``GM``. (Actually, the algorithm only constructs one vector from each pair
    ``{hv, -hv}``.) For each such vector ``hv``, intersect ``V`` with the
    half-spaces defined by ``plane_inequality(hv)`` and
    ``plane_inequality(-hv)``.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.modules.diamond_cutting import diamond_cut
        sage: V = Polyhedron([[0], [2]])
        sage: GM = matrix([2])
