def TetrahedralGraph():
    """
    Return a tetrahedral graph (with 4 nodes).

    A tetrahedron is a 4-sided triangular pyramid. The tetrahedral graph
    corresponds to the connectivity of the vertices of the tetrahedron. This
    graph is equivalent to a wheel graph with 4 nodes and also a complete graph
    on four nodes. (See examples below).

    PLOTTING: The Tetrahedral graph should be viewed in 3 dimensions. We choose
    to use a planar embedding of the graph. We hope to add rotatable,
    3-dimensional viewing in the future. In such a case, a argument will be
    added to select the desired layout.

    EXAMPLES:

    Construct and show a Tetrahedral graph::

        sage: g = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
        sage: g.show()                          # long time                             # needs sage.plot

    The following example requires networkx::

    Compare this Tetrahedral, Wheel(4), Complete(4), and the Tetrahedral plotted
    with the spring-layout algorithm below in a Sage graphics array::

        sage: tetra_spring = Graph(NX.tetrahedral_graph())
