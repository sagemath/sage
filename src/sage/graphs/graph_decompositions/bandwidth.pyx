Bandwidth of undirected graphs

Definition
----------

The bandwidth `bw(M)` of a matrix `M` is the smallest integer `k` such that all
nonzero entries of `M` are at distance `k` from the diagonal. The bandwidth
`bw(G)` of an undirected graph `G` is the minimum bandwidth of the adjacency
matrix of `G`, over all possible relabellings of its vertices.

**Path spanner:** alternatively, the bandwidth measures how tightly a path
represents the distance of a graph `G`. Indeed, if the vertices of `G` can be
ordered as `v_1,...,v_n` in such a way that `k \times d_G(v_i,v_j) \geq |i-j|` then
`bw(G)\leq k`.

    **Proof:** for all `v_i \sim v_j` (i.e. `d_G(v_i,v_j)=1`), the constraint
    ensures that `k\geq |i-j|`, meaning that adjacent vertices are at distance
    at most `k` in the path ordering. That alone is sufficient to ensure that
    `bw(G)\leq k`.

    As a byproduct, we obtain that `k \times d_G(v_i,v_j) \geq |i-j|` in
    general: let `v_{s_0},...,v_{s_i}` be the vertices of a shortest
    `(v_i,v_j)`-path. We have:

    .. MATH::

        k \times d_G(v_i,v_j) &= k\times d_G(v_i,v_{s_0}) + k\times d_G(v_{s_0},v_{s_1}) + \cdots + k\times d_G(v_{s_{i-1}},v_{s_i}) + k\times d_G(v_{s_i},v_j)\\
                              &\geq |v_i-v_{s_0}| + |v_{s_0}-v_{s_1}| + \cdots + |v_{s_{i-1}}-v_{s_i}| + |v_{s_i}-v_j|\\
                              &\geq |v_i-v_j|\\

Satisfiability of a partial assignment
--------------------------------------

Let us suppose that the first `i` vertices `v_1,...,v_i` of `G` have already
been assigned positions `p_1,...,p_i` in an ordering of `V(G)` of bandwidth
`\leq k`. Where can `v_{i+1}` appear ?

Because of the previous definition, `p_{i+1}` must be at distance at most
`k\times d_G(v_1,v_{i+1})` from `p_1`, and in general at distance at most
`k\times d_G(v_j,v_{i+1})` from `p_j`. Each range is an interval of
`\{1,...,n\}\backslash \{p_1,...,p_i\}`, and because the intersection of two
intervals is again an interval we deduce that in order to satisfy all these
constraints simultaneously `p_j` must belong to an interval defined from this
partial assignment.

Applying this rule to all non-assigned vertices, we deduce that each of them
must be assigned to a given interval of `\{1,...,n\}`. Note that this can also
be extended to the already assigned vertices, by saying that `v_j` with `j<i`
must be assigned within the interval `[p_j,p_j]`.

This problem is not always satisfiable, e.g. 5 vertices cannot all be assigned
to the elements of `[10,13]`. This is a matching problem which, because all
admissible sets are intervals, can be solved quickly.

Solving the matching problem
----------------------------

Let `n` points `v_1,...,v_n` be given, along with two functions `m,M:[n]\mapsto
[n]`. Is there an ordering `p_1,...,p_n` of them such that `m(v_i) \leq p_i \leq
M(v_i)` ? This is equivalent to Hall's bipartite matching theorem, and can in
this specific case be solved by the following algorithm:

- Consider all vertices `v` sorted increasingly according to `M(v)`

- For each of them, assign to `v` the smallest position in `[m(v),M(v)]` which
  has not been assigned yet. If there is none, the assignment problem is not
  satisfiable.

Note that the latest operation can be performed with very few bitset operations
(provided that `n<64`).

The algorithm
-------------

This section contains totally subjective choices, that may be changed in the
hope to get better performances.

- Try to find a satisfiable ordering by filling positions, one after the other
  (and not by trying to find each vertex' position)

- Fill the positions in this order: `0,n-1,1,n-2,3,n-3, ...`

.. NOTE::

    There is some symmetry to break as the reverse of a satisfiable ordering is
    also a satisfiable ordering.

def bandwidth(G, k=None):

    Compute the bandwidth of an undirected graph.

    For a definition of the bandwidth of a graph, see the documentation of the
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.bandwidth` module.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a graph

    - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``); set to an integer value to test
      whether `bw(G)\leq k`, or to ``None`` (default) to compute `bw(G)`

    OUTPUT:

    When `k` is an integer value, the function returns either ``False`` or an
    ordering of cost `\leq k`.

    When `k` is equal to ``None``, the function returns a pair ``(bw,
    ordering)``.
