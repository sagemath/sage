Tree decompositions

This module implements tree-decomposition methods.

A tree-decomposition of a graph `G = (V, E)` is a pair `(X, T)`, where `X=\{X_1,
X_2, \ldots, X_t\}` is a family of subsets of `V`, usually called *bags*, and
`T` is a tree of order `t` whose nodes are the subsets `X_i` satisfying the
following properties:

- The union of all sets `X_i` equals `V`. That is, each vertex of the graph `G`
  is associated with at least one tree node.

- For every edge `(v, w)` in the graph, there is a subset `X_i` that contains
  both `v` and `w`. That is, each edge of the graph `G` appears in a tree node.

- The nodes associated with vertex `v \in V` form a connected subtree of
  `T`. That is, if `X_i` and `X_j` both contain a vertex `v \in V`, then all
  nodes `X_k` of the tree in the (unique) path between `X_i` and `X_j` contain
  `v` as well, and we have `X_i \cap X_j \subseteq X_k`.

The *width* of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest set `X_i` minus
one, i.e., `\max_{X_i \in X} |X_i| - 1`, and the *treewidth* `tw(G)` of a graph
`G` is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of `G`. Observe
that, the size of the largest set is diminished by one in order to make the
treewidth of a tree equal to one.

The *length* of a tree decomposition, as proposed in [DG2006]_, is the maximum
*diameter* in `G` of its bags, where the diameter of a bag `X_i` is the largest
distance in `G` between the vertices in `X_i` (i.e., `\max_{u, v \in X_i}
\dist_G(u, v)`). The *treelength* `tl(G)` of a graph `G` is the minimum length
among all possible tree decompositions of `G`.

While deciding whether a graph has treelength 1 can be done in linear time
(equivalent to deciding if the graph is chordal), deciding if it has treelength
at most `k` for any fixed constant `k \leq 2` is NP-complete [Lokshtanov2009]_.

Treewidth and treelength are different measures of tree-likeness. In particular,
trees have treewidth and treelength 1::

    sage: T = graphs.RandomTree(20)
    sage: T.treewidth()
    1
    sage: T.treelength()
    1

The treewidth of a cycle is 2 and its treelength is `\lceil n/3 \rceil`::

    sage: [graphs.CycleGraph(n).treewidth() for n in range(3, 11)]
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    sage: [graphs.CycleGraph(n).treelength() for n in range(3, 11)]
    [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

The treewidth of a clique is `n-1` and its treelength is 1::

    sage: [graphs.CompleteGraph(n).treewidth() for n in range(3, 11)]
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    sage: [graphs.CompleteGraph(n).treelength() for n in range(3, 11)]
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

    separates the first atom from the rest of the graph (call G1 this part of

def treewidth(g, k=None, kmin=None, certificate=False, algorithm=None, nice=False):
    r"""
    Compute the treewidth of `g` (and provide a decomposition).

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` -- a Sage Graph

    - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``); indicates the width to be
      considered. When ``k`` is an integer, the method checks that the graph has
      treewidth `\leq k`. If ``k`` is ``None`` (default), the method computes
      the optimal treewidth.

    - ``kmin`` -- integer (default: ``None``); when specified, search for a
      tree-decomposition of width at least ``kmin``. This parameter is useful
      when the graph can be decomposed into atoms.  This parameter is ignored
      when ``k`` is not ``None`` or when ``algorithm == 'tdlib'``.

    - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the
      tree-decomposition itself

    - ``algorithm`` -- whether to use ``'sage'`` or ``'tdlib'`` (requires the
      installation of the :ref:`spkg_sagemath_tdlib` package). The default behaviour is to use
      'tdlib' if it is available, and Sage's own algorithm when it is not.

    - ``nice`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether or not to return the
      nice tree decomposition, provided ``certificate`` is ``True``

    OUTPUT:

    ``g.treewidth()`` returns treewidth of the graph ``g``.

    When ``k`` is specified, it returns ``False`` if there is no tree
    decomposition of width `\leq k`, and ``True`` otherwise.

    When ``certificate=True``, the tree decomposition is returned.

    When ``nice=True``, the nice tree decomposition is returned.

    ALGORITHM:

    This function virtually explores the graph of all pairs ``(vertex_cut, cc)``,
    where ``vertex_cut`` is a vertex cut of the graph of cardinality `\leq k+1`,
    and ``connected_component`` is a connected component of the graph induced by
    ``G-vertex_cut``.

    We deduce that the pair ``(vertex_cut, cc)`` is feasible with treewidth `k`
    if ``cc`` is empty, or if a vertex ``v`` from ``vertex_cut`` can be replaced
    with a vertex from ``cc``, such that the pair ``(vertex_cut+v,cc-v)`` is
    feasible.

    .. NOTE::

        The implementation would be much faster if ``cc``, the argument of the
        recursive function, was a bitset. It would also be very nice to not copy
        the graph in order to compute connected components, for this is really a
        waste of time.

      `w \in NT` its child, then `Bag(v) = Bag(w) \setminus \{ x \}`, where `x` is the
      forgotten node;
    - *Join* nodes have two children, both identical to the parent.

cdef class TreelengthConnected:
    r"""
    Compute the treelength of a connected graph (and provide a decomposition).

    This class implements an algorithm for computing the treelength of a
    connected graph that virtually explores the graph of all pairs
    ``(vertex_cut, connected_component)``, where ``vertex_cut`` is a vertex cut
    of the graph of length `\leq k`, and ``connected_component`` is a connected
    component of the graph induced by ``G - vertex_cut``.

    We deduce that the pair ``(vertex_cut, connected_component)`` is feasible
    with treelength `k` if ``connected_component`` is empty, or if a vertex
    ``v`` from ``vertex_cut`` can be replaced with a vertex from
    ``connected_component``, such that the pair ``(vertex_cut + v,
    connected_component - v)`` is feasible.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a sage Graph

    - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``); indicates the length to be
      considered. When `k` is an integer, the method checks that the graph has
      treelength `\leq k`. If `k` is ``None`` (default), the method computes the
      optimal treelength.

    - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to also compute
      the tree-decomposition itself

    OUTPUT:

    ``TreelengthConnected(G)`` returns the treelength of `G`. When `k` is
    specified, it returns ``False`` when no tree-decomposition of length
    `\leq k` exists or ``True`` otherwise. When ``certificate=True``, the
    tree-decomposition is also returned.

    EXAMPLES:

def treelength(G, k=None, certificate=False):
    r"""
    Compute the treelength of `G` (and provide a decomposition).

    The *length* of a tree decomposition, as proposed in [DG2006]_, is the
    maximum *diameter* in `G` of its bags, where the diameter of a bag `X_i` is
    the largest distance in `G` between the vertices in `X_i` (i.e., `\max_{u, v
    \in X_i} \dist_G(u, v)`). The *treelength* `tl(G)` of a graph `G` is the
    minimum length among all possible tree decompositions of `G`.
    See the documentation of the
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tree_decomposition` module for more
    details.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a sage Graph

    - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``); indicates the length to be
      considered. When `k` is an integer, the method checks that the graph has
      treelength `\leq k`. If `k` is ``None`` (default), the method computes the
      optimal treelength.

    - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to also return
      the tree-decomposition itself

    OUTPUT:

    ``G.treelength()`` returns the treelength of `G`. When `k` is specified, it
    returns ``False`` when no tree-decomposition of length `\leq k` exists or
    ``True`` otherwise. When ``certificate=True``, the tree-decomposition is
    also returned.

    ALGORITHM:

    This method virtually explores the graph of all pairs ``(vertex_cut,
    connected_component)``, where ``vertex_cut`` is a vertex cut of the graph of
    length `\leq k`, and ``connected_component`` is a connected component of the
    graph induced by ``G - vertex_cut``.

    We deduce that the pair ``(vertex_cut, connected_component)`` is feasible
    with treelength `k` if ``connected_component`` is empty, or if a vertex
    ``v`` from ``vertex_cut`` can be replaced with a vertex from
    ``connected_component``, such that the pair ``(vertex_cut + v,
    connected_component - v)`` is feasible.

    In practice, this method decomposes the graph by its clique minimal
    separators into atoms, computes the treelength of each of atom and returns
    the maximum value over all the atoms. Indeed, we have that `tl(G) = \max_{X
    \in A} tl(G[X])` where `A` is the set of atoms of the decomposition by
    clique separators of `G`. When ``certificate == True``, the
    tree-decompositions of the atoms are connected to each others by adding
    edges with respect to the clique separators.

        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: the tree decomposition of a disconnected graph is not defined

    Chordal graphs have treelength 1::

        sage: while not G.is_connected():
        ....:     G = graphs.RandomChordalGraph(30)
        sage: G.treelength()
        1

    Cycles have treelength `\lceil n/3 \rceil`::

        sage: [graphs.CycleGraph(n).treelength() for n in range(3, 11)]
        [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
