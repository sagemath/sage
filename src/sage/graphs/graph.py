Graph Format
------------

Supported formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sage Graphs can be created from a wide range of inputs. A few examples are
covered here.

- NetworkX dictionary format:

   ::

       sage: d = {0: [1,4,5], 1: [2,6], 2: [3,7], 3: [4,8], 4: [9], \
       ....: 5: [7, 8], 6: [8,9], 7: [9]}
       sage: G = Graph(d); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                           # needs sage.plot

- A NetworkX graph:

   ::

       sage: # needs networkx
       sage: import networkx
       sage: K = networkx.complete_bipartite_graph(12,7)
       sage: G = Graph(K)
       sage: G.degree()
       [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]

- graph6 or sparse6 format:

   ::

       sage: s = ':I`AKGsaOs`cI]Gb~'
       sage: G = Graph(s, sparse=True); G
       Looped multi-graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                           # needs sage.plot

   Note that the ``\`` character is an escape character in Python, and also a
   character used by graph6 strings:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\n@GUA')
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       RuntimeError: the string (Ihe) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short

   In Python, the escaped character ``\`` is represented by ``\\``:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\\n@GUA')
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                           # needs sage.plot

- adjacency matrix: In an adjacency matrix, each column and each row represent a
   vertex. If a 1 shows up in row `i`, column `j`, there is an edge `(i,j)`.

   ::

       sage: # needs sage.modules
       sage: M = Matrix([(0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0), (1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0),
       ....:             (0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0),
       ....:             (1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1), (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0), (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1),
       ....:             (0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1), (0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0), (0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0)])
       sage: M
       [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
       [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
       [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
       [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
       [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
       [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
       [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
       [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
       [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]
       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                           # needs sage.plot

- incidence matrix: In an incidence matrix, each row represents a vertex and
   each column represents an edge.

   ::

       sage: # needs sage.modules
       sage: M = Matrix([(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)])
       sage: M
       [-1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
       [ 1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0]
       [ 0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0]

       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                           # needs sage.plot
       sage: DiGraph(matrix(2, [0,0,-1,1]), format='incidence_matrix')
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       ValueError: there must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column

- a list of edges::

       sage: g = Graph([(1, 3), (3, 8), (5, 2)]); g
       Graph on 5 vertices

- an igraph Graph::

       sage: import igraph                                 # optional - python_igraph
       sage: g = Graph(igraph.Graph([(1,3),(3,2),(0,2)]))  # optional - python_igraph
       sage: g                                             # optional - python_igraph
       Graph on 4 vertices

Generators
----------

Use ``graphs(n)`` to iterate through all non-isomorphic graphs of given size::

    sage: for g in graphs(4):
    ....:     print(g.degree_sequence())
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
    [2, 1, 1, 0]
    [3, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
    [2, 2, 1, 1]
    [2, 2, 2, 0]
    [3, 2, 2, 1]
    [2, 2, 2, 2]
    [3, 3, 2, 2]
    [3, 3, 3, 3]

Similarly ``graphs()`` will iterate through all graphs. The complete graph of 4
vertices is of course the smallest graph with chromatic number bigger than
three::

    sage: for g in graphs():
    ....:     if g.chromatic_number() > 3:
    ....:         break
    sage: g.is_isomorphic(graphs.CompleteGraph(4))
    True

For some commonly used graphs to play with, type::

    sage: graphs.[tab]          # not tested

and hit {tab}. Most of these graphs come with their own custom plot, so you can
see how people usually visualize these graphs.

::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()                                              # needs sage.plot
    sage: G.degree_histogram()
    [0, 0, 0, 10]
    sage: G.adjacency_matrix()                                                          # needs sage.modules
    [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
    [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
    [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
    [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]

::

    sage: S = G.subgraph([0,1,2,3])
    sage: S.plot().show()    # or S.show()                                              # needs sage.plot
    sage: S.density()
    1/2

::

    sage: G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: L = G.get_graphs_list()
    sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L)                                                    # needs sage.plot

.. _Graph:labels:

Labels
------

Each vertex can have any hashable object as a label. These are things like
strings, numbers, and tuples. Each edge is given a default label of ``None``,
but if specified, edges can have any label at all. Edges between vertices `u`
and `v` are represented typically as ``(u, v, l)``, where ``l`` is the label for
the edge.

Note that vertex labels themselves cannot be mutable items::

    sage: M = Matrix([[0,0], [0,0]])                                                    # needs sage.modules
    sage: G = Graph({ 0 : { M : None } })                                               # needs sage.modules
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable

However, if one wants to define a dictionary, with the same keys and arbitrary
objects for entries, one can make that association::

    sage: d = {0 : graphs.DodecahedralGraph(), 1 : graphs.FlowerSnark(), \
    ....: 2 : graphs.MoebiusKantorGraph(), 3 : graphs.PetersenGraph() }
    sage: d[2]
    Moebius-Kantor Graph: Graph on 16 vertices
    sage: T = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
    sage: T.vertices(sort=True)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    sage: T.set_vertices(d)
    sage: T.get_vertex(1)
    Flower Snark: Graph on 20 vertices

Database
--------

There is a database available for searching for graphs that satisfy a certain
set of parameters, including number of vertices and edges, density, maximum and
minimum degree, diameter, radius, and connectivity. To see a list of all search
parameter keywords broken down by their designated table names, type ::

    sage: graph_db_info()
    {...}

For more details on data types or keyword input, enter ::

    sage: GraphQuery?    # not tested

The results of a query can be viewed with the show method, or can be viewed
individually by iterating through the results ::

    sage: Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'],num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: Q.show()
    Graph6
    --------------------
    F?`po
    F?gqg
    F@?]O
    F@OKg
    F@R@o
    FA_pW
    FEOhW
    FGC{o
    FIAHo

Show each graph as you iterate through the results::

    sage: for g in Q:                                                                   # needs sage.plot
    ....:     show(g)

Visualization
-------------

To see a graph `G` you are working with, there are three main options. You can
view the graph in two dimensions via matplotlib with ``show()``. ::

    sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(15,.3)
    sage: G.show()                                                                      # needs sage.plot

And you can view it in three dimensions with ``show3d()``. ::

    sage: G.show3d()                                                                    # needs sage.plot

Or it can be rendered with `\LaTeX`.  This requires the right additions to a
standard `\mbox{\rm\TeX}` installation.  Then standard Sage commands, such as
``view(G)`` will display the graph, or ``latex(G)`` will produce a string
suitable for inclusion in a `\LaTeX` document.  More details on this are at the
:mod:`sage.graphs.graph_latex` module. ::

    sage: from sage.graphs.graph_latex import check_tkz_graph
    sage: check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation
    sage: latex(G)
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

Mutability
----------

Graphs are mutable, and thus unusable as dictionary keys, unless
``data_structure="static_sparse"`` is used::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: {G:1}[G]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable.
    Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`
    sage: G_immutable = Graph(G, immutable=True)
    sage: G_immutable == G
    True
    sage: {G_immutable:1}[G_immutable]
    1

    r"""
    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. See the
    :wikipedia:`Graph_(mathematics)` for more information. For a collection of
    pre-defined graphs, see the :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators` module.

    A :class:`Graph` object has many methods whose list can be obtained by
    typing ``g.<tab>`` (i.e. hit the :kbd:`Tab` key) or by reading the documentation
    of :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph`, :mod:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph`, and
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.digraph`.

    INPUT:

    By default, a :class:`Graph` object is simple (i.e. no *loops* nor *multiple
    edges*) and unweighted. This can be easily tuned with the appropriate flags
    (see below).

    - ``data`` -- can be any of the following (see the ``format`` argument):

      #. ``Graph()`` -- build a graph on 0 vertices.

      #. ``Graph(5)`` -- return an edgeless graph on the 5 vertices 0,...,4.

      #. ``Graph([list_of_vertices, list_of_edges])`` -- returns a graph with
         given vertices/edges.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph([V, E], format='vertices_and_edges')``.

      #. ``Graph(list_of_edges)`` -- return a graph with a given list of edges
         (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.add_edges`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(L, format='list_of_edges')``.

      #. ``Graph({1: [2, 3, 4], 3: [4]})`` -- return a graph by associating to
         each vertex the list of its neighbors.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(D, format='dict_of_lists')``.

      #. ``Graph({1: {2: 'a', 3:'b'} ,3:{2:'c'}})`` -- return a graph by
         associating a list of neighbors to each vertex and providing its edge
         label.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(D, format='dict_of_dicts')``.

         For graphs with multiple edges, you can provide a list of labels
         instead, e.g.: ``Graph({1: {2: ['a1', 'a2'], 3:['b']} ,3:{2:['c']}})``.

      #. ``Graph(a_symmetric_matrix)`` -- return a graph with given (weighted)
         adjacency matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.adjacency_matrix`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit ``Graph(M,
         format='adjacency_matrix')``. To take weights into account, use
         ``format='weighted_adjacency_matrix'`` instead.

      #. ``Graph(a_nonsymmetric_matrix)`` -- return a graph with given incidence
         matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.incidence_matrix`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(M, format='incidence_matrix')``.

      #. ``Graph([V, f])`` -- return a graph from a vertex set ``V`` and a
         *symmetric* function ``f``. The graph contains an edge `u,v` whenever
         ``f(u,v)`` is ``True``.. Example: ``Graph([ [1..10], lambda x,y:
         abs(x-y).is_square()])``

      #. ``Graph(':I`ES@obGkqegW~')`` -- return a graph from a graph6 or sparse6
         string (see documentation of :meth:`graph6_string` or
         :meth:`sparse6_string`).

      #. ``Graph(a_seidel_matrix, format='seidel_adjacency_matrix')`` -- return
         a graph with a given Seidel adjacency matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`seidel_adjacency_matrix`).

      #. ``Graph(another_graph)`` -- return a graph from a Sage (di)graph,
         `pygraphviz <https://pygraphviz.github.io/>`__ graph, `NetworkX
         <https://networkx.github.io/>`__ graph, or `igraph
         <http://igraph.org/python/>`__ graph.

    - ``pos`` -- a positioning dictionary (cf. documentation of
      :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.layout`). For example, to
      draw 4 vertices on a square::

         {0: [-1,-1],
          1: [ 1,-1],
          2: [ 1, 1],
          3: [-1, 1]}

    - ``name`` -- (must be an explicitly named parameter, i.e.,
       ``name='complete')`` gives the graph a name

    - ``loops`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to allow loops (ignored
      if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class)

    - ``multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to allow multiple
      edges (ignored if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class)

    - ``weighted`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether graph thinks of
      itself as weighted or not. See
      :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.weighted`.

    - ``format`` -- if set to ``None`` (default), :class:`Graph` tries to guess
      input's format. To avoid this possibly time-consuming step, one of the
      following values can be specified (see description above): ``'int'``,
      ``'graph6'``, ``'sparse6'``, ``'rule'``, ``'list_of_edges'``,
      ``'dict_of_lists'``, ``'dict_of_dicts'``, ``'adjacency_matrix'``,
      ``'weighted_adjacency_matrix'``, ``'seidel_adjacency_matrix'``,
      ``'incidence_matrix'``, ``"NX"``, ``'igraph'``.

    - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); ``sparse=True`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="sparse"``, and ``sparse=False`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="dense"``.

    - ``data_structure`` -- one of the following (for more information, see
      :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`)

       * ``'dense'`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.dense_graph`
         backend.

       * ``'sparse'`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph`
         backend.

       * ``'static_sparse'`` -- selects the
         :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend` (this backend is faster
         than the sparse backend and smaller in memory, and it is immutable, so
         that the resulting graphs can be used as dictionary keys).

    - ``immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to create a
      immutable graph. Note that ``immutable=True`` is actually a shortcut for
      ``data_structure='static_sparse'``. Set to ``False`` by default.

    - ``hash_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to include edge
      labels during hashing. This parameter defaults to ``True`` if the graph is
      weighted. This parameter is ignored if the graph is mutable.
      Beware that trying to hash unhashable labels will raise an error.

    - ``vertex_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to allow any
      object as a vertex (slower), or only the integers `0,...,n-1`, where `n`
      is the number of vertices.

    - ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` -- this arguments sets the default
      edge labels used by NetworkX (empty dictionaries) to be replaced by
      ``None``, the default Sage edge label. It is set to ``True`` iff a
      NetworkX graph is on the input.

    EXAMPLES:

    We illustrate the first seven input formats (the other two involve packages
    that are currently not standard in Sage):

    #. An integer giving the number of vertices::

        sage: g = Graph(5); g
        Graph on 5 vertices
        sage: g.vertices(sort=True)
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        sage: g.edges(sort=False)
        []

    #. A dictionary of dictionaries::

        sage: g = Graph({0:{1:'x',2:'z',3:'a'}, 2:{5:'out'}}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

       The labels ('x', 'z', 'a', 'out') are labels for edges. For example,
       'out' is the label for the edge on 2 and 5. Labels can be used as
       weights, if all the labels share some common parent.::

        sage: a, b, c, d, e, f = sorted(SymmetricGroup(3))                              # needs sage.groups
        sage: Graph({b: {d: 'c', e: 'p'}, c: {d: 'p', e: 'c'}})                         # needs sage.groups
        Graph on 4 vertices

    #. A dictionary of lists::

        sage: g = Graph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

    #. A list of vertices and a function describing adjacencies. Note that the
       list of vertices and the function must be enclosed in a list (i.e., [list
       of vertices, function]).

       Construct the Paley graph over GF(13).::

          sage: g = Graph([GF(13), lambda i,j: i!=j and (i-j).is_square()])             # needs sage.rings.finite_rings
          sage: g.vertices(sort=True)                                                   # needs sage.rings.finite_rings

          [1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0]

       Construct the line graph of a complete graph.::

          sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
          sage: line_graph = Graph([g.edges(sort=True, labels=false),
          ....:                     lambda i,j: len(set(i).intersection(set(j)))>0],
          ....:                    loops=False)
          sage: line_graph.vertices(sort=True)
          [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
          sage: line_graph.adjacency_matrix()                                           # needs sage.modules
          [0 1 1 1 1 0]

       If ``vertex_labels`` is ``True``, the names of the vertices are given by
       the vertex attribute ``'name'``, if available::

       If the igraph Graph has edge attributes, they are used as edge labels::

    When defining an undirected graph from a function ``f``, it is *very*
    important that ``f`` be symmetric. If it is not, anything can happen::

        sage: f_sym = lambda x,y: abs(x-y) == 1
        sage: f_nonsym = lambda x,y: (x-y) == 1
        sage: G_sym = Graph([[4,6,1,5,3,7,2,0], f_sym])
        sage: G_sym.is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(8))
        True
        sage: G_nonsym = Graph([[4,6,1,5,3,7,2,0], f_nonsym])
        sage: G_nonsym.size()
        4
        sage: G_nonsym.is_isomorphic(G_sym)

    By default, graphs are mutable and can thus not be used as a dictionary
    key::

          ...
          TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable.
          Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`

    When providing the optional arguments ``data_structure="static_sparse"`` or
    ``immutable=True`` (both mean the same), then an immutable graph results::

          sage: G_imm = Graph(G, immutable=True)
          sage: H_imm = Graph(G, data_structure='static_sparse')
          sage: G_imm == H_imm == G

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          certificate. The method only returns boolean answers when
          ``certificate = False`` (default). When it is set to ``True``, it
          either answers ``(True, None)`` when the graph is a tree or ``(False,
          cycle)`` when it contains a cycle. It returns ``(False, None)`` when
          the graph is empty or not connected.

        - ``output`` -- either ``'vertex'`` (default) or ``'edge'``; whether the
          certificate is given as a list of vertices (``output = 'vertex'``) or
          a list of edges (``output = 'edge'``).

        When the certificate cycle is given as a list of edges, the edges are
        given as `(v_i, v_{i+1}, l)` where `v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n` are the
        vertices of the cycles (in their cyclic order).

        Test whether the current graph is overfull.

        A graph `G` on `n` vertices and `m` edges is said to be overfull if:

        - `n` is odd

        - It satisfies `2m > (n-1)\Delta(G)`, where `\Delta(G)` denotes the
          maximum degree among all vertices in `G`.

        An overfull graph must have a chromatic index of `\Delta(G)+1`.

        A Hole is a cycle of length at least 4 (included). It is said to be even

        Even-hole-free graphs always contain a bisimplicial vertex, which

            \sum_{i=1}^\omega d_i = \omega (\omega - 1) + \sum_{i=\omega + 1}^nd_i

        where `\omega = max \{i:d_i\geq i-1\}`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Split graphs are, in particular, chordal graphs. Hence, The Petersen
        graph can not be split::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().is_split()
            False

        We can easily build some "random" split graph by creating a complete
        graph, and adding vertices only connected to some random vertices of the
        clique::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(10)
            sage: sets = Subsets(Set(range(10)))
            sage: for i in range(10, 25):
            ....:    g.add_edges([(i,k) for k in sets.random_element()])
            sage: g.is_split()
            True

        Another characterisation of split graph states that a graph is a split
        graph if and only if does not contain the 4-cycle, 5-cycle or `2K_2` as
        an induced subgraph. Hence for the above graph we have::

            sage: forbidden_subgraphs = [graphs.CycleGraph(4),
            ....:                        graphs.CycleGraph(5),
            ....:                        2 * graphs.CompleteGraph(2)]
            sage: sum(g.subgraph_search_count(H, induced=True)                          # needs sage.modules
            ....:     for H in forbidden_subgraphs)
            0
        """
        self._scream_if_not_simple()
        # our degree sequence is numbered from 0 to n-1, so to avoid
        # any mistake, let's fix it :-)
        degree_sequence = [0] + sorted(self.degree(), reverse=True)

        for i, d in enumerate(degree_sequence):
            if d >= i - 1:
                omega = i
            else:
                break

        left = sum(degree_sequence[:omega + 1])
        right = omega * (omega - 1) + sum(degree_sequence[omega + 1:])

        return left == right

    def is_perfect(self, certificate=False):
        r"""
        Test whether the graph is perfect.

        A graph `G` is said to be perfect if `\chi(H)=\omega(H)` hold for any
        induced subgraph `H\subseteq_i G` (and so for `G` itself, too), where
        `\chi(H)` represents the chromatic number of `H`, and `\omega(H)` its
        clique number. The Strong Perfect Graph Theorem [CRST2006]_ gives
        another characterization of perfect graphs:

        A graph is perfect if and only if it contains no odd hole (cycle on an
        odd number `k` of vertices, `k>3`) nor any odd antihole (complement of a
        hole) as an induced subgraph.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          certificate

        OUTPUT:

        When ``certificate = False``, this function returns a boolean
        value. When ``certificate = True``, it returns a subgraph of ``self``
        isomorphic to an odd hole or an odd antihole if any, and ``None``
        otherwise.

        EXAMPLES:

        A Bipartite Graph is always perfect ::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomBipartite(8,4,.5)                                    # needs numpy
            sage: g.is_perfect()                                                        # needs numpy sage.modules
            True

        So is the line graph of a bipartite graph::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomBipartite(4,3,0.7)                                   # needs numpy
            sage: g.line_graph().is_perfect()   # long time                             # needs numpy sage.modules
            True

        As well as the Cartesian product of two complete graphs::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(3).cartesian_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))
            sage: g.is_perfect()                                                        # needs sage.modules
            True

        Interval Graphs, which are chordal graphs, too ::

            sage: g =  graphs.RandomIntervalGraph(7)
            sage: g.is_perfect()                                                        # needs sage.modules
            True

        The PetersenGraph, which is triangle-free and has chromatic number 3 is
        obviously not perfect::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.is_perfect()                                                        # needs sage.modules
            False

        We can obtain an induced 5-cycle as a certificate::

            sage: g.is_perfect(certificate=True)                                        # needs sage.modules

        OUTPUT:

        - When a solution exists, this method outputs the degree-constrained
          subgraph as a Graph object.

        - When no solution exists, returns ``False``.

        .. NOTE::

            - This algorithm computes the degree-constrained subgraph of minimum
              weight.
            - If the graph's edges are weighted, these are taken into account.
            - This problem can be solved in polynomial time.

            the chromatic polynomial. Again, this method is inefficient in terms
            of speed and it only useful for small graphs.

          - ``'MILP'``: the chromatic number is computed using a mixed integer
            linear program. The performance of this implementation is affected
            by whether optional MILP solvers have been installed (see the
            :mod:`MILP module <sage.numerical.mip>`, or Sage's tutorial on
            Linear Programming).

          - ``'parallel'``: all the above algorithms are executed in parallel
            and the result is returned as soon as one algorithm ends. Observe
            that the speed of the above algorithms depends on the size and
            structure of the graph.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specifies a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the

        in [Sta1995]_, specifically Theorem 2.5 states that

        .. MATH::

            X_G = \sum_{F \subseteq E(G)} (-1)^{|F|} p_{\lambda(F)},

        where `\lambda(F)` is the partition of the sizes of the connected
        components of the subgraph induced by the edges `F` and `p_{\mu}` is the
        powersum symmetric function.

        INPUT:

        - ``R`` -- (optional) the base ring for the symmetric functions;
          this uses `\ZZ` by default

        ALGORITHM:

        We traverse a binary tree whose leaves correspond to subsets of
        edges, and whose internal vertices at depth `d` correspond to a
        choice of whether to include the `d`-th edge in a given subset.
        The components of the induced subgraph are incrementally
        updated using a disjoint-set forest. If the next edge would
        introduce a cycle to the subset, we prune the branch as the
        terms produced by the two subtrees cancel in this case.

        Return the fractional clique number of the graph.

        A fractional clique is a nonnegative weight function on the vertices of
        a graph such that the sum of the weights over any independent set is at
        most 1. The fractional clique number is the largest total weight of a
        fractional clique, which is equal to the fractional chromatic number by
        LP-duality.

        ALGORITHM:

        The fractional clique number is computed via the Linear Program for
        fractional chromatic number, see :meth:`fractional_chromatic_number
        <sage.graphs.graph_coloring.fractional_chromatic_number>`

        INPUT:

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``'PPL'``) specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For

          .. NOTE::

              The default solver used here is ``'PPL'`` which provides exact
              results, i.e. a rational number, although this may be slower that
              using other solvers.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: 0); sets the level of verbosity of
          the LP solver

        - ``check_components`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether the
          method is called on each biconnected component of `G`

        - ``check_bipartite`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether the graph
          is checked for bipartiteness. If the graph is bipartite then we can
          avoid creating and solving the LP.

        Return the Maximum Average Degree (MAD) of the current graph.

        The Maximum Average Degree (MAD) of a graph is defined as the average
        degree of its densest subgraph. More formally, ``Mad(G) =
        \max_{H\subseteq G} Ad(H)``, where `Ad(G)` denotes the average degree of
        `G`.

        This can be computed in polynomial time.

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

          - If ``value_only=True``, only the numerical value of the `MAD` is
            returned.

          - Else, the subgraph of `G` realizing the `MAD` is returned.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: 0); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        EXAMPLES:

        In any graph, the `Mad` is always larger than the average degree::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.3)
            sage: mad_g = g.maximum_average_degree()                                    # needs sage.numerical.mip
            sage: g.average_degree() <= mad_g                                           # needs sage.numerical.mip
            True

        Unlike the average degree, the `Mad` of the disjoint union of two graphs
        is the maximum of the `Mad` of each graphs::

            sage: h = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.3)
            sage: mad_h = h.maximum_average_degree()                                    # needs sage.numerical.mip
            sage: (g+h).maximum_average_degree() == max(mad_g, mad_h)                   # needs sage.numerical.mip
            True

        The subgraph of a regular graph realizing the maximum average degree is
        always the whole graph ::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: mad_g = g.maximum_average_degree(value_only=False)                    # needs sage.numerical.mip

            True

        This also works for complete bipartite graphs ::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,4)
            sage: mad_g = g.maximum_average_degree(value_only=False)                    # needs sage.numerical.mip

            True

        Return the vertices of a minor isomorphic to `H` in the current graph.

        We say that a graph `G` has a `H`-minor (or that it has a graph
        isomorphic to `H` as a minor), if for all `h\in H`, there exist disjoint
        sets `S_h \subseteq V(G)` such that once the vertices of each `S_h` have
        been merged to create a new graph `G'`, this new graph contains `H` as a
        subgraph.

        When parameter ``induced`` is ``True``, this method returns an induced minor
        isomorphic to `H`, if it exists.

        We say that a graph `G` has an induced `H`-minor (or that it has a
        graph isomorphic to `H` as an induced minor), if `H` can be obtained
        from an induced subgraph of `G` by contracting edges. Otherwise, `G` is
        said to be `H`-induced minor-free.

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of a

        We can also try to prove this way that the Petersen graph is not planar,

            sage: K5_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(5))   # long time             # needs sage.numerical.mip

            sage: K33_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,3))       # long time, needs sage.numerical.mip

        (It is much faster to use the linear-time test of planarity in this
        situation, though.)

        As there is no cycle in a tree, looking for a `K_3` minor is useless.

          weights are taken into account; if ``False``, all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - ``'BFS'`` -- the computation is done through a BFS centered on each
            vertex successively. Works only if ``by_weight==False``

          - ``'DHV'`` -- the computation is done using the algorithm proposed in
            [Dragan2018]_. Works only if ``self`` has nonnegative edge weights

            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works only if ``by_weight==False`` and
            ``v is None`` or ``v`` should contain all vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Python'`` -- a Python implementation of the
            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works also with weighted graphs, even with
            negative weights (but no negative cycle is allowed). However, ``v``
            must be ``None`` or ``v`` should contain all vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'Dijkstra_NetworkX'`` -- the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
            NetworkX. It works with weighted graphs, but no negative weight is
            allowed.

          - ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` -- the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in Boost
            (works only with positive weights)

          - ``'Johnson_Boost'`` -- the Johnson algorithm, implemented in
            Boost (works also with negative weights, if there is no negative
            cycle). Works only if ``v is None`` or ``v`` should contain all
            vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'From_Dictionary'`` -- uses the (already computed) distances, that
            are provided by input variable ``dist_dict``

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm:
            ``'From_Dictionary'`` if ``dist_dict`` is not None, ``'BFS'`` for
            unweighted graphs, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are
            positive, ``'Johnson_Boost'`` otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` as a
          weight, if ``l`` is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge

        - ``dist_dict`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); a dict of dicts of
          distances (used only if ``algorithm=='From_Dictionary'``)

        - ``with_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          list or a dictionary keyed by vertices

            (works only with positive weights).

          - ``'Johnson_Boost'``: the Johnson algorithm, implemented in
            Boost (works also with negative weights, if there is no negative
            cycle).

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm: ``'iFUB'`` for
            unweighted graphs, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are positive,
            ``'Johnson_Boost'`` otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that

        Return the set of vertices in the periphery of the graph.

        The periphery is the set of vertices whose eccentricity is equal to the
        diameter of the graph, i.e., achieving the maximum eccentricity.

        For more information and examples on how to use input variables,
        see :meth:`~GenericGraph.shortest_paths` and
        :meth:`~Graph.eccentricity`

        INPUT:

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, edge
          weights are taken into account; if ``False``, all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); see method
          :meth:`eccentricity` for the list of available algorithms

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` as a
          weight, if ``l`` is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge

    def distance_graph(self, dist):
        r"""
        Return the graph on the same vertex set as the original graph but
        vertices are adjacent in the returned graph if and only if they are at
        specified distances in the original graph.

        INPUT:

        - ``dist`` -- nonnegative integer or a list of nonnegative integers;
          specified distance(s) for the connecting vertices. ``Infinity`` may
          be used here to describe vertex pairs in separate components.

        OUTPUT:

        The returned value is an undirected graph.  The vertex set is identical
        to the calling graph, but edges of the returned graph join vertices
        whose distance in the calling graph are present in the input ``dist``.
        Loops will only be present if distance 0 is included. If the original
        graph has a position dictionary specifying locations of vertices for
        plotting, then this information is copied over to the distance graph.
        In some instances this layout may not be the best, and might even be
        confusing when edges run on top of each other due to symmetries chosen
        for the layout.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3)
            sage: H = G.cartesian_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
            sage: K = H.distance_graph(2)
            sage: K.am()                                                                # needs sage.modules

            [0 1 0 1 0 0]
            [1 0 1 0 0 0]

        To obtain the graph where vertices are adjacent if their distance apart
        is ``d`` or less use a ``range()`` command to create the input, using
        ``d + 1`` as the input to ``range``. Notice that this will include
        distance 0 and hence place a loop at each vertex. To avoid this, use
        ``range(1, d + 1)``::

            sage: G = graphs.OddGraph(4)
            sage: d = G.diameter()
            sage: n = G.num_verts()
            sage: H = G.distance_graph(list(range(d+1)))
            sage: H.is_isomorphic(graphs.CompleteGraph(n))
            False
            sage: H = G.distance_graph(list(range(1,d+1)))
            sage: H.is_isomorphic(graphs.CompleteGraph(n))
            True

        A complete collection of distance graphs will have adjacency matrices
        that sum to the matrix of all ones::

            sage: P = graphs.PathGraph(20)
            sage: all_ones = sum([P.distance_graph(i).am() for i in range(20)])         # needs sage.modules
            sage: all_ones == matrix(ZZ, 20, 20, [1]*400)                               # needs sage.modules
            True

        Four-bit strings differing in one bit is the same as
        four-bit strings differing in three bits::

            sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(4)
            sage: H = G.distance_graph(3)
            sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)
            True

        The graph of eight-bit strings, adjacent if different in an odd number
        of bits::

            sage: # long time, needs sage.symbolic
            sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(8)
            sage: H = G.distance_graph([1,3,5,7])
            sage: degrees = [0]*sum([binomial(8,j) for j in [1,3,5,7]])
            sage: degrees.append(2^8)
            sage: degrees == H.degree_histogram()
            True

        connected::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3)
            sage: H = G.disjoint_union(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
            sage: L = H.distance_graph(Infinity)

            True

        r"""
        Return a topological `H`-minor from ``self`` if one exists.

        We say that a graph `G` has a topological `H`-minor (or that it has a
        graph isomorphic to `H` as a topological minor), if `G` contains a
        subdivision of a graph isomorphic to `H` (i.e.  obtained from `H`
        through arbitrary subdivision of its edges) as a subgraph.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Minor_(graph_theory)`.

        INPUT:

        - ``H`` -- the topological minor to find in the current graph

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specifies a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: 0); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        The topological `H`-minor found is returned as a subgraph `M` of
        ``self``, such that the vertex `v` of `M` that represents a vertex `h\in
        H` has ``h`` as a label (see :meth:`get_vertex
        <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_vertex>` and
        :meth:`set_vertex <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.set_vertex>`),
        and such that every edge of `M` has as a label the edge of `H` it
        (partially) represents.

        If no topological minor is found, this method returns ``False``.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming.

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of a
        topological `H`-minor is polynomial. The known algorithms are highly
        exponential in `H`, though.

        .. NOTE::

            This function can be expected to be *very* slow, especially where
            the topological minor does not exist.

            (CPLEX seems to be *much* more efficient than GLPK on this kind of
            problem)

        EXAMPLES:

        Petersen's graph has a topological `K_4`-minor::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.topological_minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(4))                          # needs sage.numerical.mip

        Return a minimum vertex cover of ``self`` represented by a set of vertices.

        A minimum vertex cover of a graph is a set `S` of vertices such that
        each edge is incident to at least one element of `S`, and such that `S`
        is of minimum cardinality. For more information, see the
        :wikipedia:`Vertex_cover`.

        Equivalently, a vertex cover is defined as the complement of an
        independent set.

        As an optimization problem, it can be expressed as follows:

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{v\in G} b_v\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\forall (u,v) \in G.edges(), b_u+b_v\geq 1\\
            &\forall x\in G, b_x\mbox{ is a binary variable}

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'Cliquer'``); indicating which
          algorithm to use. It can be one of those values.

          - ``'Cliquer'`` will compute a minimum vertex cover using the Cliquer
            package

          - ``'MILP'`` will compute a minimum vertex cover through a mixed
            integer linear program

          - ``'mcqd'`` will use the MCQD solver
            (`<http://www.sicmm.org/~konc/maxclique/>`_). Note that the MCQD
            package must be installed.

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if set to ``True``,
          only the size of a minimum vertex cover is returned. Otherwise,
          a minimum vertex cover is returned as a list of vertices.

        - ``reduction_rules`` -- (default: ``True``) specify if the reductions
          rules from kernelization must be applied as pre-processing or not.
          See [ACFLSS04]_ for more details. Note that depending on the instance,
          it might be faster to disable reduction rules.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specifies a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: 0); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        EXAMPLES:

        On the Pappus graph::

           sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: g.vertex_cover(value_only=True)
           9

        .. PLOT::

            g = graphs.PappusGraph()
            sphinx_plot(g.plot(partition=[g.vertex_cover()]))

        TESTS:

        The two algorithms should return the same result::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(10, .5)
           sage: vc1 = g.vertex_cover(algorithm='MILP')                                 # needs sage.numerical.mip
           sage: vc2 = g.vertex_cover(algorithm='Cliquer')
           sage: len(vc1) == len(vc2)                                                   # needs sage.numerical.mip
           True

        The cardinality of the vertex cover is unchanged when reduction rules
        are used. First for trees::

           sage: for i in range(20):
           ....:     g = graphs.RandomTree(20)
           ....:     vc1_set = g.vertex_cover()
           ....:     vc1 = len(vc1_set)
           ....:     vc2 = g.vertex_cover(value_only=True, reduction_rules=False)
           ....:     if vc1 != vc2:
           ....:         print("Error :", vc1, vc2)
           ....:         print("With reduction rules :", vc1)
           ....:         print("Without reduction rules :", vc2)
           ....:         break
           ....:     g.delete_vertices(vc1_set)
           ....:     if g.size():
           ....:         print("This thing is not a vertex cover !")

        Then for random GNP graphs::

           sage: for i in range(20):
           ....:     g = graphs.RandomGNP(50, 0.08)
           ....:     vc1_set = g.vertex_cover()
           ....:     vc1 = len(vc1_set)
           ....:     vc2 = g.vertex_cover(value_only=True, reduction_rules=False)
           ....:     if vc1 != vc2:
           ....:         print("Error :", vc1, vc2)
           ....:         print("With reduction rules :", vc1)
           ....:         print("Without reduction rules :", vc2)
           ....:         break
           ....:     g.delete_vertices(vc1_set)
           ....:     if g.size():
           ....:         print("This thing is not a vertex cover !")

        Testing mcqd::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().vertex_cover(algorithm='mcqd', value_only=True)  # optional - mcqd
            6

        Return an Ear decomposition of the graph.

        An ear of an undirected graph `G` is a path `P` where the two endpoints
        of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where otherwise no
        repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of
        `P` has degree two in `P`.

        An ear decomposition of an undirected graph `G` is a partition of its
        set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that the one or two endpoints
        of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the
        internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Ear_decomposition`.

        This method implements the linear time algorithm presented in
        [Sch2013]_.

        OUTPUT:

        - A nested list representing the cycles and chains of the ear
          decomposition of the graph.

        (for homomorphisms cores, see the :meth:`Graph.has_homomorphism_to`
        method)

        DEFINITIONS:

        * *K-cores* in graph theory were introduced by Seidman in 1983 and by
          Bollobas in 1984 as a method of (destructively) simplifying graph
          topology to aid in analysis and visualization. They have been more
          recently defined as the following by Batagelj et al:

          *Given a graph `G` with vertices set `V` and edges set `E`, the
          `k`-core of `G` is the graph obtained from `G` by recursively removing
          the vertices with degree less than `k`, for as long as there are any.*

          This operation can be useful to filter or to study some properties of
          the graphs. For instance, when you compute the 2-core of graph G, you
          are cutting all the vertices which are in a tree part of graph.  (A
          tree is a graph with no loops). See the :wikipedia:`K-core`.

          [PSW1996]_ defines a `k`-core of `G` as the largest subgraph (it is
          unique) of `G` with minimum degree at least `k`.

        * Core number of a vertex

          The core number of a vertex `v` is the largest integer `k` such that
          `v` belongs to the `k`-core of `G`.

        * Degeneracy

          The *degeneracy* of a graph `G`, usually denoted `\delta^*(G)`, is the
          smallest integer `k` such that the graph `G` can be reduced to the
          empty graph by iteratively removing vertices of degree `\leq k`.
          Equivalently, `\delta^*(G) = k - 1` if `k` is the smallest integer
          such that the `k`-core of `G` is empty.

        IMPLEMENTATION:

        This implementation is based on the NetworkX implementation of the
        algorithm described in [BZ2003]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``)

            * If ``k = None`` (default), returns the core number for each vertex.

            * If ``k`` is an integer, returns a pair ``(ordering, core)``, where
              ``core`` is the list of vertices in the `k`-core of ``self``, and
              ``ordering`` is an elimination order for the other vertices such
              that each vertex is of degree strictly less than `k` when it is to
              be eliminated from the graph.

        - ``with_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); when set to
          ``False``, and ``k = None``, the method returns a list whose `i` th
          element is the core number of the `i` th vertex. When set to ``True``,
          the method returns a dictionary whose keys are vertices, and whose
          values are the corresponding core numbers.

        .. SEEALSO::

            * Graph cores is also a notion related to graph homomorphisms. For
              this second meaning, see :meth:`Graph.has_homomorphism_to`.

        Return the modular decomposition of the current graph.

        A module of an undirected graph is a subset of vertices such that every
        vertex outside the module is either connected to all members of the
        module or to none of them. Every graph that has a nontrivial module can
        be partitioned into modules, and the increasingly fine partitions into
        modules form a tree. The ``modular_decomposition`` method returns
        that tree.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); the algorithm to use
          among:

          - ``None`` or ``'corneil_habib_paul_tedder'`` -- will use the
            Corneil-Habib-Paul-Tedder algorithm from [TCHP2008]_, its complexity
            is linear in the number of vertices and edges.

          - ``'habib_maurer'`` -- will use the Habib-Maurer algorithm from
            [HM1979]_, its complexity is cubic in the number of vertices.

        - ``style`` -- string (default: ``'tuple'``); specifies the output
          format:

          - ``'tuple'`` -- as nested tuples

          - ``'tree'`` -- as :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree`

        OUTPUT:

        The modular decomposition tree, either as nested tuples (if
        ``style='tuple'``) or as an object of
        :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree` (if
        ``style='tree'``)

        Crash course on modular decomposition:

        A module `M` of a graph `G` is a proper subset of its vertices such
        that for all `u \in V(G)-M, v,w\in M` the relation `u \sim v
        \Leftrightarrow u \sim w` holds, where `\sim` denotes the adjacency
        relation in `G`. Equivalently, `M \subset V(G)` is a module if all its
        vertices have the same adjacency relations with each vertex outside of
        the module (vertex by vertex).

        Hence, for a set like a module, it is very easy to encode the
        information of the adjacencies between the vertices inside and outside
        the module -- we can actually add a new vertex `v_M` to our graph
        representing our module `M`, and let `v_M` be adjacent to `u\in V(G)-M`
        if and only if some `v\in M` (and hence all the vertices contained in
        the module) is adjacent to `u`. We can now independently (and
        recursively) study the structure of our module `M` and the new graph
        `G-M+\{v_M\}`, without any loss of information.

        Here are two very simple modules :

        * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
          them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for instance, is a module, as no
          vertex of `C` has a neighbor outside of it.

        * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of them) of
          a non-anticonnected graph `G`, for the same reason (it is just the
          complement of the previous graph !).

        These modules being of special interest, the disjoint union of graphs is
        called a Parallel composition, and the complement of a disjoint union is
        called a Series composition. A graph whose only modules are singletons
        is called Prime.

        For more information on modular decomposition, in particular for an
        explanation of the terms "Parallel," "Prime" and "Series," see the
        :wikipedia:`Modular_decomposition`.

            (PRIME, [1, 2, 0, 3, 4])

        The Petersen Graph too::

              (PARALLEL, [6, 7]),
              (SERIES, [(PARALLEL, [10, 11]), 9, 8])])

        This a clique on 5 vertices with 2 pendant edges, though, has a more

             [(PARALLEL, [7, 8, 9, 10]), (PARALLEL, [3, 4, 5, 6]), (PARALLEL, [0, 1, 2])])

        We can choose output to be a
        :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree`::

            sage: g.modular_decomposition(style='tree')

        Test whether the graph is the graph of a circumscribed polyhedron.

        A polyhedron is circumscribed if all of its facets are tangent to a
        sphere. By a theorem of Rivin ([HRS1993]_), this can be checked by
        solving a linear program that assigns weights between 0 and 1/2 on each
        edge of the polyhedron, so that the weights on any face add to exactly
        one and the weights on any non-facial cycle add to more than one.  If

        Return a decomposition of the graph into 2-factors.

        Petersen's 2-factor decomposition theorem asserts that any `2r`-regular
        graph `G` can be decomposed into 2-factors.  Equivalently, it means that
        the edges of any `2r`-regular graphs can be partitioned in `r` sets
        `C_1,\dots,C_r` such that for all `i`, the set `C_i` is a disjoint union
        of cycles (a 2-regular graph).

        As any graph of maximal degree `\Delta` can be completed into a regular
        graph of degree `2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil`, this result also means
        that the edges of any graph of degree `\Delta` can be partitioned in
        `r=2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil` sets `C_1,\dots,C_r` such that for all
        `i`, the set `C_i` is a graph of maximal degree `2` (a disjoint union of
        paths and cycles).

        INPUT:

          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the

        This is a polynomial in variables `t_e` (each of them representing an

        .. MATH::

            \Psi_G(t) = \sum_{\substack{T\subseteq V \\ \text{a spanning tree}}} \prod_{e \not\in E(T)} t_e

        INPUT:

        - ``name`` -- name of the variables (default: ``'t'``)

        OUTPUT: a polynomial with integer coefficients

        ALGORITHM:

            This is computed here using a determinant, as explained in Section
            3.1 of [Mar2009a]_.

            As an intermediate step, one computes a cycle basis `\mathcal C` of
            `G` and a rectangular `|\mathcal C| \times |E(G)|` matrix with
            entries in `\{-1,0,1\}`, which describes which edge belong to which
            cycle of `\mathcal C` and their respective orientations.

            More precisely, after fixing an arbitrary orientation for each edge
            `e\in E(G)` and each cycle `C\in\mathcal C`, one gets a sign for
            every incident pair (edge, cycle) which is `1` if the orientation
            coincide and `-1` otherwise.

        EXAMPLES:

    def magnitude_function(self):
        r"""
        Return the magnitude function of the graph as a rational function.

        This is defined as the sum of all coefficients in the inverse of the
        matrix `Z` whose coefficient `Z_{i,j}` indexed by a pair of vertices
        `(i,j)` is `q^d(i,j)` where `d` is the distance function in the graph.

        By convention, if the distance from `i` to `j` is infinite (for two
        vertices not path connected) then `Z_{i,j}=0`.

        The value of the magnitude function at `q=0` is the cardinality of the
        graph. The magnitude function of a disjoint union is the sum of the
        magnitudes functions of the connected components. The magnitude function
        of a Cartesian product is the product of the magnitudes functions of the
        factors.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g = Graph({1:[], 2:[]})
            sage: g.magnitude_function()                                                # needs sage.modules

            5/(2*q^2 + 2*q + 1)

        One can expand the magnitude as a power series in `q` as follows::

            sage: q = QQ[['q']].gen()
            sage: m(q)                                                                  # needs sage.modules

        One can also use the substitution `q = exp(-t)` to obtain the magnitude
        function as a function of `t`::

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(6)
            sage: m = g.magnitude_function()                                            # needs sage.modules

        `G` after added all edges `((v,0),(v,1))` for all vertices `v`.

        INPUT:

        - ``extended`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the
          extended bipartite double, or only the bipartite double (default)

        OUTPUT: a graph; ``self`` is left untouched

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: H = G.bipartite_double()
            sage: G == graphs.PetersenGraph()  # G is left invariant
            True
            sage: H.order() == 2 * G.order()
            True
            sage: H.size() == 2 * G.size()
            True
            sage: H.is_bipartite()
            True
            sage: H.bipartite_sets() == (set([(v, 0) for v in G]),
            ....: set([(v, 1) for v in G]))
            True
            sage: H.is_isomorphic(G.tensor_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2)))
            True

        Behaviour with disconnected graphs::

            sage: G1 = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: G2 = graphs.HoffmanGraph()
            sage: G = G1.disjoint_union(G2)
            sage: H = G.bipartite_double()
            sage: H1 = G1.bipartite_double()
            sage: H2 = G2.bipartite_double()
            sage: H.is_isomorphic(H1.disjoint_union(H2))
            True
