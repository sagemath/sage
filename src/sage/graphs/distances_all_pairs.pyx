Distances/shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

This module implements a few functions that deal with the computation of
distances or shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

**Efficiency** : Because these functions involve listing many times the
(out)-neighborhoods of (di)-graphs, it is useful in terms of efficiency to build
a temporary copy of the graph in a data structure that makes it easy to compute
quickly. These functions also work on large volume of data, typically dense
matrices of size `n^2`, and are expected to return corresponding dictionaries of
size `n^2`, where the integers corresponding to the vertices have first been
converted to the vertices' labels. Sadly, this last translating operation turns
out to be the most time-consuming, and for this reason it is also nice to have a
Cython module, and version of these functions that return C arrays, in order to
avoid these operations when they are not necessary.

**Memory cost** : The methods implemented in the current module sometimes need
large amounts of memory to return their result. Storing the distances between
all pairs of vertices in a graph on `1500` vertices as a dictionary of
dictionaries takes around 200MB, while storing the same information as a C array
requires 4MB.


The module's main function
--------------------------

The C function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` actually does all the
computations, and all the others (except for ``Floyd_Warshall``) are just
wrapping it. This function begins with copying the graph in a data structure
that makes it fast to query the out-neighbors of a vertex, then starts one
Breadth First Search per vertex of the (di)graph.

**What can this function compute ?**

- The matrix of predecessors.

  This matrix `P` has size `n^2`, and is such that vertex `P[u,v]` is a
  predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this matrix efficiently
  encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any `u,v\in G` : indeed,
  to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest `uP[u,v]`-path, then
  jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its outneighbors. Apply recursively
  and find out what the whole path is !.

- The matrix of distances.

  This matrix has size `n^2` and associates to any `uv` the distance
  from `u` to `v`.

- The vector of eccentricities.

  This vector of size `n` encodes for each vertex `v` the distance to vertex
  which is furthest from `v` in the graph. In particular, the diameter of the
  graph is the maximum of these values.

**What does it take as input ?**

- ``gg`` a (Di)Graph.

- ``unsigned short * predecessors`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
  `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not want to
  compute the predecessors.

- ``unsigned short * distances`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
  `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. The computation of the distances is
  necessary for the algorithm, so this value can **not** be set to ``NULL``.

- ``int * eccentricity`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
  `n\cdot\text{sizeof(int)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not want to compute the
  eccentricity.

**Technical details**

- The vertices are encoded as `1, ..., n` as they appear in the ordering of
  ``G.vertices(sort=True)``, unless another ordering is specified by the user.

- Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared to
  the number of vertices when computing all distances or predecessors, it uses
  short variables to store the vertices' names instead of long ones to divide by
  2 the size in memory. This means that only the diameter/eccentricities can be
  computed on a graph of more than 65536 nodes. For information, the current
  version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536=2^{16}` nodes creates in
  memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each), for a total of
  `2^{33}` bytes or `8` gigabytes. In order to support larger sizes, we would
  have to replace shorts by 32-bits int or 64-bits int, which would then require
  respectively 16GB or 32GB.

- In the C version of these functions, infinite distances are represented with
  ``<unsigned short> -1 = 65535`` for ``unsigned short`` variables, and by
  ``INT32_MAX`` otherwise. These case happens when the input is a disconnected
  graph, or a non-strongly-connected digraph.

- A memory error is raised when data structures allocation failed. This could
  happen with large graphs on computers with low memory space.

.. WARNING::

    The function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` has **no reason** to be called
    by the user, even though he would be writing his code in Cython and look for
    efficiency. This module contains wrappers for this function that feed it
    with the good parameters. As the function is inlined, using those wrappers
    actually saves time as it should avoid testing the parameters again and
    again in the main function's body.

def is_distance_regular(G, parameters=False):

    Test if the graph is distance-regular.

    A graph `G` is distance-regular if for any integers `j,k` the value of
    `|\{x:d_G(x,u)=j,x\in V(G)\} \cap \{y:d_G(y,v)=j,y\in V(G)\}|` is constant
    for any two vertices `u,v\in V(G)` at distance `i` from each other. In
    particular `G` is regular, of degree `b_0` (see below), as one can take
    `u=v`.

    Equivalently a graph is distance-regular if there exist integers `b_i,c_i`
    such that for any two vertices `u,v` at distance `i` we have

    * `b_i = |\{x:d_G(x,u)=i+1,x\in V(G)\}\cap N_G(v)\}|, \ 0\leq i\leq d-1`
    * `c_i = |\{x:d_G(x,u)=i-1,x\in V(G)\}\cap N_G(v)\}|, \ 1\leq i\leq d,`

    where `d` is the diameter of the graph.  For more information on
    distance-regular graphs, see the :wikipedia:`Distance-regular_graph`.

    INPUT:

    - ``parameters`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if set to ``True``, the
      function returns the pair ``(b, c)`` of lists of integers instead of
      a boolean answer (see the definition above)

def distances_and_predecessors_all_pairs(G):
    r"""
    Return the matrix of distances in G and the matrix of predecessors.

    Distances : the matrix `M` returned is of length `n^2`, and the distance
    between vertices `u` and `v` is `M[u,v]`. The integer corresponding to a
    vertex is its index in the list ``G.vertices(sort=True)``.

    Predecessors : the matrix `P` returned has size `n^2`, and is such that
    vertex `P[u,v]` is a predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this
    matrix efficiently encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any
    `u,v\in G` : indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
    `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
    outneighbors.

def diameter(G, algorithm=None, source=None):
    r"""
    Return the diameter of `G`.

    This method returns Infinity if the (di)graph is not connected. It can
    also quickly return a lower bound on the diameter using the ``2sweep``,
    ``2Dsweep`` and ``multi-sweep`` schemes.

    INPUT:

    - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); specifies the algorithm to
      use among:

      - ``'standard'`` -- computes the diameter of the input (di)graph as the
        largest eccentricity of its vertices. This is the classical algorithm
        with time complexity in `O(nm)`.

      - ``'2sweep'`` -- computes a lower bound on the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph using 2 BFS, as proposed in [MLH2008]_.  It
        first selects a vertex `v` that is at largest distance from an initial
        vertex source using BFS. Then it performs a second BFS from `v`. The
        largest distance from `v` is returned as a lower bound on the diameter
        of `G`.  The time complexity of this algorithm is linear in the size of
        `G`.

      - ``'2Dsweep'`` -- computes lower bound on the diameter of an unweighted
        directed graph using directed version of ``2sweep`` as proposed in
        [Broder2000]_. If the digraph is not strongly connected, the returned
        value is infinity.

      - ``'DHV'`` -- computes diameter of unweighted undirected graph using the
        algorithm proposed in [Dragan2018]_

      - ``'multi-sweep'`` -- computes a lower bound on the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph using several iterations of the ``2sweep``
        algorithms [CGHLM2013]_. Roughly, it first uses ``2sweep`` to identify
        two vertices `u` and `v` that are far apart. Then it selects a vertex
        `w` that is at same distance from `u` and `v`.  This vertex `w` will
        serve as the new source for another iteration of the ``2sweep``
        algorithm that may improve the current lower bound on the diameter.
        This process is repeated as long as the lower bound on the diameter
        is improved.

      - ``'iFUB'`` -- the iFUB (iterative Fringe Upper Bound) algorithm,
        proposed in [CGILM2010]_, computes the exact value of the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph. It is based on the following observation:

            The diameter of the graph is equal to the maximum eccentricity of
            a vertex. Let `v` be any vertex, and let `V` be partitioned into
            `A\cup B` where:

            .. MATH::

                d(v,a) \leq i, \forall a \in A\\
                d(v,b) \geq i, \forall b \in B

            As all vertices from `A` are at distance `\leq 2i` from each
            other, a vertex `a\in A` with eccentricity `ecc(a)>2i` is at
            distance `ecc(a)` from some vertex `b\in B`.

            Consequently, if we have already computed the maximum eccentricity
            `m` of all vertices in `B` and if `m>2i`, then we do not need to
            compute the eccentricity of the vertices in `A`.

        Starting from a vertex `v` obtained through a multi-sweep computation
        (which refines the 4sweep algorithm used in [CGHLM2013]_), we compute
        the diameter by computing the eccentricity of all vertices sorted
        decreasingly according to their distance to `v`, and stop as allowed
        by the remark above. The worst case time complexity of the iFUB
        algorithm is `O(nm)`, but it can be very fast in practice.

      - ``'DiFUB'`` -- the directed version of iFUB (iterative Fringe Upper
        Bound) algorithm. See the code's documentation and [CGLM2012]_ for more
        details. If the digraph is not strongly connected, the returned value is
        infinity.

    - ``source`` -- (default: ``None``) vertex from which to start the first BFS.
      If ``source==None``, an arbitrary vertex of the graph is chosen. Raise an
      error if the initial vertex is not in `G`.  This parameter is not used
      when ``algorithm=='standard'``.

    .. NOTE::
        As the graph is first converted to a short_digraph, all complexity
        have an extra `O(m+n)` for ``SparseGraph`` and `O(n^2)` for
        ``DenseGraph``.

    The Wiener index of an undirected graph `G` is defined as

cdef uint64_t c_szeged_index_low_memory(short_digraph sd) noexcept:

    Return the Szeged index of the graph.

    Let `G = (V, E)` be a connected simple graph, and for any `uv\in E`, let
    `N_u(uv) = \{w\in V:d(u,w)<d(v,w)\}` and `n_u(uv)=|N_u(uv)|`. The Szeged
    index of `G` is then defined as [KRG1996]_ as `\sum_{uv \in
    E(G)}n_u(uv)\times n_v(uv)`.

    To determine `N_u(uv)`, this method performs a breadth first search (BFS)
    from each vertex `s \in V`. Then, each time an edge `uv` visited by the BFS
    is such that `d(s, u) < d(s, v)`, it adds 1 to `N_u(uv)`. Since this method
    assumes that the graph is undirected, the graph `sd` has both arcs `uv` and
    `vu`. Using one counter per arc, the counter for arc `uv` records the number
    of vertices that are closer to the side `u` of edge `uv`, and the counter
    for arc `vu` records the number of vertices that are closer to the side `v`
    of edge `uv`.

    This method assumes that the input graph has no loops or multiple edges.

def distances_distribution(G):

    Return the distances distribution of the (di)graph in a dictionary.

    This method *ignores all edge labels*, so that the distance considered is
    the topological distance.

    OUTPUT:

        A dictionary ``d`` such that the number of pairs of vertices at distance
        ``k`` (if any) is equal to `d[k] \cdot |V(G)| \cdot (|V(G)|-1)`.

    .. NOTE::

        We consider that two vertices that do not belong to the same connected
        component are at infinite distance, and we do not take the trivial pairs
        of vertices `(v, v)` at distance `0` into account. Empty (di)graphs and

def antipodal_graph(G):
    r"""
    Return the antipodal graph of `G`.

    The antipodal graph of a graph `G` has the same vertex set of `G` and
    two vertices are adjacent if their distance in `G` is equal to the
    diameter of `G`.

    This method first computes the eccentricity of all vertices and determines
    the diameter of the graph. Then, it for each vertex `u` with eccentricity
    the diameter, it computes BFS distances from `u` and add an edge in the
    antipodal graph for each vertex `v` at diameter distance from `u`
    (i.e., for each antipodal vertex).

    The drawback of this method is that some BFS distances may be computed
    twice, one time to determine the eccentricities and another time is the
    vertex has eccentricity equal to the diameter. However, in practive, this is
    much more efficient. See the documentation of method
    :meth:`c_eccentricity_DHV`.

    EXAMPLES:

    The antipodal graph of a grid graph has only 2 edges::

        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import antipodal_graph
        sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5, 5)
        sage: A = antipodal_graph(G)
        sage: A.order(), A.size()
        (25, 2)

    The antipodal graph of a disjoint union of cliques is its complement::

        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import antipodal_graph
        sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3) * 3
        sage: A = antipodal_graph(G)
        sage: A.is_isomorphic(G.complement())
        True

    The antipodal graph can also be constructed as the
    :meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.distance_graph` for diameter distance::

        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import antipodal_graph
        sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(10, .2)
        sage: A = antipodal_graph(G)
        sage: B = G.distance_graph(G.diameter())
        sage: A.is_isomorphic(B)

# Floyd-Warshall #

def floyd_warshall(gg, paths=True, distances=False):
    r"""
    Compute the shortest path/distances between all pairs of vertices.

    For more information on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, see
    the :wikipedia:`Floyd-Warshall_algorithm`.

    INPUT:

    - ``gg`` -- the graph on which to work

    - ``paths`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to return the dictionary
      of shortest paths

    - ``distances`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the
      dictionary of distances

    OUTPUT:

    Depending on the input, this function return the dictionary of paths, the
    dictionary of distances, or a pair of dictionaries ``(distances, paths)``
    where ``distance[u][v]`` denotes the distance of a shortest path from `u` to
    `v` and ``paths[u][v]`` denotes an inneighbor `w` of `v` such that
    `dist(u,v) = 1 + dist(u,w)`.

    .. WARNING::

        Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
        to the number of vertices, it uses short variables instead of long ones
        to divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that the current
        implementation does not run on a graph of more than 65536 nodes (this
        can be easily changed if necessary, but would require much more
        memory. It may be worth writing two versions). For information, the
        current version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536 = 2^{16}` nodes
        creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each),
        for a total of `2^{34}` bytes or `16` gigabytes. Let us also remember
        that if the memory size is quadratic, the algorithm runs in cubic time.

    .. NOTE::

        When ``paths = False`` the algorithm saves roughly half of the memory as
        it does not have to maintain the matrix of predecessors. However,
        setting ``distances=False`` produces no such effect as the algorithm can
        not run without computing them. They will not be returned, but they will
        be stored while the method is running.

    EXAMPLES:

    Shortest paths in a small grid ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(2,2)
        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import floyd_warshall
        sage: print(floyd_warshall(g))
        {(0, 0): {(0, 0): None, (0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 0): (0, 0), (1, 1): (0, 1)},
         (0, 1): {(0, 1): None, (0, 0): (0, 1), (1, 0): (0, 0), (1, 1): (0, 1)},
         (1, 0): {(1, 0): None, (0, 0): (1, 0), (0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 1): (1, 0)},
         (1, 1): {(1, 1): None, (0, 0): (0, 1), (0, 1): (1, 1), (1, 0): (1, 1)}}

    Checking the distances are correct ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5)
        sage: dist,path = floyd_warshall(g, distances=True)
        sage: all(dist[u][v] == g.distance(u, v) for u in g for v in g)
        True

    Checking a random path is valid ::

        sage: u,v = g.random_vertex(), g.random_vertex()
        sage: p = [v]
        sage: while p[0] is not None:
        ....:   p.insert(0,path[u][p[0]])
        sage: len(p) == dist[u][v] + 2
        True

    Distances for all pairs of vertices in a diamond::

        sage: g = graphs.DiamondGraph()
        sage: floyd_warshall(g, paths=False, distances=True)
        {0: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2},
         1: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1},
