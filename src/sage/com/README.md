# conditional-oriented-matroids
SageMath functions manipulating conditional oriented matroids. Among other functions, the check if a set corresponds to a conditional oriented matroid, the generating of that latter from its tope set, its Varchenko determinant computing, and the solving of its Aguiar-Mahajan system are implemented.
