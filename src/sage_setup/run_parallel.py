## Parallel gcc execution
##
## This code is responsible for making distutils dispatch the calls to
## build_ext in parallel. Since distutils doesn't seem to do this by
## default, we create our own extension builder and override the
## appropriate methods.  Unfortunately, in distutils, the logic of
## deciding whether an extension needs to be recompiled and actually
## making the call to gcc to recompile the extension are in the same
## function. As a result, we can't just override one function and have
## everything magically work. Instead, we split this work between two
## functions. This works fine for our application, but it means that
## we can't use this modification to make the other parts of Sage that
## build with distutils call gcc in parallel.
