Flint imports

TESTS:

Import this module::

    sage: import sage.libs.flint.flint_sage

We verify that :issue:`6919` is correctly fixed::

    sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
    sage: A = 2^(2^17+2^15)
    sage: a = A * x^31
    sage: b = (A * x) * x^30
    sage: a == b
    True

# Try to clean up after ourselves before sage terminates. This
# probably doesn't do anything if your copy of flint is re-entrant
# (and most are). Moreover it isn't strictly necessary, because the OS
# will reclaim these resources anyway after sage terminates. However
# this might reveal other bugs, and can help tools like valgrind do
# their jobs.
