#  Set some environment variables that are needed at the runtime of Sage
#  and by its child processes.
#
#  This file is only for use when sage is invoked from SAGE_ROOT.
#  It is not installed in SAGE_LOCAL.
#
#  NOTES:
#  - You must *source* this script instead of executing.
#  - Use "return" instead of "exit" to signal a failure.  Since this
#    file is sourced, an "exit" here will actually exit src/bin/sage,
#    which is probably not intended.
#  - Environment variables that should be available in the Sage environment
#    should be exported.
#  - This file is only for setting immediate values.  Any kind of conditionals
#    or computed values are to be set by src/bin/sage-env after sourcing this
#    file.
#  - Environment variables that are only needed at the time of building
#    SPKGs or sagelib should be set in build/bin/sage-build-env-config
#    instead.

# SAGE_VENV is the root of the virtual environment of sagelib.
# By default, it is identical to SAGE_LOCAL
export SAGE_VENV="@SAGE_VENV@"

# SAGE_ROOT is the location of the Sage source/build tree.
