=============================
Testing on Multiple Platforms
=============================

Sage is intended to build and run on a variety of platforms,
including all major Linux distributions, as well as macOS, and
Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

There is considerable variation among these platforms.
To ensure that Sage continues to build correctly on users'
machines, it is crucial to test changes to Sage, in particular
when external packages are added or upgraded, on a wide
spectrum of platforms.

- Individual PR, upon creation and update, automatically goes through "checks"
  implemented by `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions>`_
  to identify errors early and ensure code quality. In particular, Build & Test
  workflows perform an incremental build of Sage on the PR branch and run
  doctests on a selection of major platforms including Ubuntu, macOS, and
  Conda.

  For PRs making changes to external packages, the Docker-based testing workflow
  `CI Linux incremental <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/workflows/ci-linux-incremental.yml>`_
  checks the PR branch on an array of Linux platforms.

- Before a new release, the release manager runs a fleet of `buildbots
  <http://build.sagemath.org>`_ to make it sure that Sage builds correctly on
  all of our supported platforms.

- After a new release, our Docker-based testing workflows `CI Linux <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml>`_
  and `CI macOS <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/workflows/ci-macos.yml>`_
  perform extensive testing on a multitude of platforms.

- Sage developers and users are encouraged to test releases that are announced
  on `Sage Release <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-release>`_ on
  their machines and to report the results (successes and failures) by
  responding to the announcements.

In the rest, we focus on our Docker-based testing framework that developers can
use to test Sage and fix portability issues for platforms other than their own
machines.


Docker-based testing
====================

`Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ is a popular virtualization
software, running Linux operating system images ("Docker images") in
containers on a shared Linux kernel.  These containers can be run
using a Docker client on your Linux, Mac, or Windows box, as well as
on various cloud services.

To get started, you need to install a `Docker client
<https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_.  The clients are available for
Linux, Mac, and Windows.  The clients for the latter are known as
"Docker Desktop".

Make sure that your Docker client is configured to provide enough RAM
to the containers (8 GB are a good choice). In Docker Desktop this
setting is in Preferences -> Resources -> Advanced.

.. NOTE::

   All examples in this section were obtained using Docker Desktop for
   Mac; but the `command-line user interface
   <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/>`_ for the
   other platforms is identical.

   As an alternative, you can also run Docker in GitHub Codespaces
   (or another cloud service) using a container with the Docker-in-Docker
   feature. Sage provides a suitable dev container configuration
   `.devcontainer/tox-docker-in-docker
   <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/tox-docker-in-docker>`_:

   .. ONLY:: html

      .. image:: https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg
         :align: center
         :target: https://codespaces.new/sagemath/sage?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Ftox-docker-in-docker%2Fdevcontainer.json

All major Linux distributions provide ready-to-use Docker images,
which are published via `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_
or other container registries.  For
example, to run the current stable (LTS) version of Ubuntu
interactively, you can use the shell command::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker run -it ubuntu:latest
  root@9f3398da43c2:/#

Here ``ubuntu`` is referred to as the "image (name)" and ``latest`` as
the "tag".  Other releases of Ubuntu are available under different
tags, such as ``xenial`` or ``devel``.

The above command drops you in a root shell on the container::

  root@9f3398da43c2:/# uname -a
  Linux 9f3398da43c2 4.19.76-linuxkit #1 SMP Thu Oct 17 19:31:58 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  root@9f3398da43c2:/# df -h
  Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  overlay         181G  116G   56G  68% /
  tmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev
  tmpfs           2.7G     0  2.7G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
  shm              64M     0   64M   0% /dev/shm

  tmpfs           2.7G     0  2.7G   0% /sys/firmware

Exiting the shell terminates the container::

  root@9f3398da43c2:/# ^D
  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$

Let us work with a distclean Sage source tree.  If you are using git,
a good way to get one (without losing a precious installation in
``SAGE_LOCAL``) is by creating a new worktree::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage] git worktree add worktree-ubuntu-latest
  [mkoeppe@sage sage] cd worktree-ubuntu-latest
  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest] ls
  COPYING.txt ... Makefile ... configure.ac ... src tox.ini

This is not bootstrapped (``configure`` is missing), so let's bootstrap it::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest] make configure
  ...

We can start a container again with same image, ``ubuntu:latest``, but
this time let's mount the current directory into it::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$ docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/sage ubuntu:latest
  root@39d693b2a75d:/# mount | grep sage
  osxfs on /sage type fuse.osxfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,max_read=1048576)
  root@39d693b2a75d:/# cd sage
  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# ls
  COPYING.txt ... Makefile ... config configure configure.ac ... src tox.ini

Typical Docker images provide minimal installations of packages only::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# command -v python
  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# command -v gcc
  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage#

As you can see above, the image ``ubuntu:latest`` has neither a Python nor
a GCC installed, which are among the build prerequisites of Sage.  We
need to install them using the Linux distribution's package manager first.

Sage facilitates testing various Linux distributions on Docker as follows.

Discovering the system's package system
---------------------------------------

::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# build/bin/sage-guess-package-system
  debian

Let's install gcc, hoping that the Ubuntu package providing it is
simply named ``gcc``.  If we forgot what the package manager on
Debian-derived Linux distributions is called, we can ask Sage for a
reminder::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command debian install gcc
  apt-get install gcc

We remember that we need to fetch the current package lists
from the server first::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# apt-get update
  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# apt-get install gcc

Using Sage's database of distribution prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------

The source code of the Sage distribution contains a database of
package names in various distributions' package managers.  For
example, the file ``build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/debian.txt`` contains the following

.. code-block:: yaml

  # This file, build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/debian.txt, contains names
  # of Debian/Ubuntu packages needed for installation of Sage from source.
  #
  # In addition, the files build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/debian.txt contain the names
  # of packages that provide the equivalent of SPKG.
  #
  # Everything on a line after a # character is ignored.
  binutils
  make
  m4
  perl
  # python3-minimal is not enough on debian buster, ubuntu bionic - it does not have urllib
  python3    # system python for bootstrapping the build
  tar
  bc
  gcc
  # On debian buster, need C++ even to survive 'configure'. Otherwise:
  # checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... /lib/cpp
  # configure: error: in `/sage':
  # configure: error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check
  g++
  # Needed if we download some packages from a https upstream URL
  ca-certificates

From this information, we know that we can use the following command
on our container to install the necessary build prerequisites::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# apt-get install binutils make m4 perl python3 \
                                           tar bc gcc g++ ca-certificates
  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree
  Reading state information... Done
  tar is already the newest version (1.29b-2ubuntu0.1).
  The following additional packages will be installed:
  ...
  Done.

(The Sage `Installation Guide <../installation/index.html>`_ also
provides such command lines for some distributions; these are
automatically generated from the database of package names.)

Now we can start the build::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# ./configure
  checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
  checking for root user... yes
  configure: error: You cannot build Sage as root, switch to an unprivileged user.
  (If building in a container, use --enable-build-as-root.)

Let's just follow this helpful hint::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# ./configure --enable-build-as-root
  checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
  ...


.. _section-equiv-distro-packages:

Using Sage's database of equivalent distribution packages
---------------------------------------------------------

At the end of the ``./configure`` run, Sage issued a message like the
following::

  configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:
                     boost_cropped bzip2 ... zeromq zlib
  checking for the package system in use... debian
  configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and
                   may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
  configure:   $ sudo apt-get install ... libzmq3-dev libz-dev
  configure: After installation, re-run configure using:
  configure:   $ make reconfigure

This information comes from Sage's database of equivalent system
packages.  For example::

  $ ls build/pkgs/flint/distros/
  alpine.txt  fedora.txt  gentoo.txt   macports.txt  opensuse.txt  void.txt
  conda.txt   debian.txt  freebsd.txt  homebrew.txt  nix.txt       repology.txt
  $ cat build/pkgs/flint/distros/debian.txt
  libflint-dev

Note that these package equivalencies are based on a current stable or
testing version of the distribution; the packages are not guaranteed
to exist in every release or derivative distribution.

The Sage distribution is intended to build correctly no matter what
superset of the set of packages forming the minimal build
prerequisites is installed on the system.  If it does not, this is a
bug of the Sage distribution and should be reported and fixed on a
ticket.  Crucial part of a bug report is the configuration of the
system, in particular a list of installed packages and their versions.

Let us install a subset of these packages::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# apt-get install libbz2-dev bzip2 libz-dev
  Reading package lists... Done
  ...
  Setting up zlib1g-dev:amd64 (1:1.2.11.dfsg-0ubuntu2) ...
  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage#


Committing a container to disk
------------------------------

After terminating the container, the following command shows the status
of the container you just exited::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/sage# ^D
  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$ docker ps -a | head -n3
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS
  39d693b2a75d   ubuntu:latest   "/bin/bash"   8 minutes ago   Exited (0) 6 seconds ago
  9f3398da43c2   ubuntu:latest   "/bin/bash"   8 minutes ago   Exited (0) 8 minutes ago

We can go back to the container with the command::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$ docker start -a -i 39d693b2a75d
  root@9f3398da43c2:/#

Here, ``39d693b2a75d`` is the container id, which appeared in the
shell prompts and in the output of ``docker ps``.

We can create a new image corresponding to its current state::

  root@39d693b2a75d:/# ^D
  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$ docker commit 39d693b2a75d ubuntu-latest-minimal-17
  sha256:4151c5ca4476660f6181cdb13923da8fe44082222b984c377fb4fd6cc05415c1

where ``ubuntu-latest-minimal-17`` is an arbitrary symbolic name for the new
image. The output of the command is the id of the new image. We can use either
the symbolic name or the id to refer to the new image.

We can run the image and get a new container with the same state as
the one that we terminated.  Again we want to mount our worktree into
it; otherwise, because we did not make a copy, the new container will
have no access to the worktree::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$ docker run -it \
    --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/sage ubuntu-latest-minimal-17
  root@73987568712c:/# cd sage
  root@73987568712c:/sage# command -v gcc
  /usr/bin/gcc
  root@73987568712c:/sage# command -v bunzip2
  /usr/bin/bunzip2
  root@73987568712c:/sage# ^D
  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-ubuntu-latest]$

The image ``ubuntu-latest-minimal-17`` can be run in as many
containers as we want and can also be shared with other users or
developers so that they can run it in a container on their machine.
(See the Docker documentation on how to `share images on Docker Hub
<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part3/>`_ or to `save images to a
tar archive
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/>`_.)

This facilitates collaboration on fixing portability bugs of the Sage
distribution.  After reproducing a portability bug on a container,
several developers can work on fixing the bug using containers running
on their respective machines.


Generating dockerfiles
----------------------

Sage also provides a script for generating a ``Dockerfile``, which is
a recipe for automatically building a new image::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ .ci/write-dockerfile.sh debian ":standard: :optional:" > Dockerfile

(The second argument is passed to ``sage -package list`` to find packages for the listed package types.)

.. this interface should be improved obviously. See #29146 - Refactor tox.ini and build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh

The ``Dockerfile`` instructs the command ``docker build`` to build a
new Docker image.  Let us take a quick look at the generated file;
this is slightly simplified::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ cat Dockerfile
  # Automatically generated by SAGE_ROOT/.ci/write-dockerfile.sh
  # the :comments: separate the generated file into sections
  # to simplify writing scripts that customize this file
  ...

First, it instructs ``docker build`` to start from an existing base
image...::

  ...
  ARG BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:latest
  FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
  ...

Then, to install system packages...::

  ...
  RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -qqq --no-install-recommends --yes binutils make m4 perl python3 ... libzmq3-dev libz-dev && apt-get clean

Then, to bootstrap and configure...::

  RUN mkdir -p /sage
  WORKDIR /sage
  ADD Makefile VERSION.txt README.md bootstrap configure.ac sage ./
  ADD src/doc/bootstrap src/doc/bootstrap
  ADD m4 ./m4
  ADD build ./build
  RUN ./bootstrap
  ADD src/bin src/bin
  ARG EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS=""
  RUN ./configure --enable-build-as-root ${EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS} || (cat config.log; exit 1)

Finally, to build and test...::

  ARG NUMPROC=8
  ENV MAKE="make -j${NUMPROC}"
  ARG USE_MAKEFLAGS="-k"
  RUN make ${USE_MAKEFLAGS} base-toolchain
  ARG TARGETS_PRE="all-sage-local"
  RUN make ${USE_MAKEFLAGS} ${TARGETS_PRE}
  ADD src src
  ARG TARGETS="build ptest"
  RUN make ${USE_MAKEFLAGS} ${TARGETS}

You can customize the image build process by passing build arguments to the
command ``docker build``.  For example::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker build . -f Dockerfile \
    --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:latest \
    --build-arg NUMPROC=4 \
    --build-arg EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-python=/usr/bin/python3.42"

These arguments (and their default values) are defined using ``ARG``
commands in the ``Dockerfile``.

The above command will build Sage from scratch and will therefore take
quite long.  Let us instead just do a partial build, consisting of one
small package, by setting the arguments ``TARGETS_PRE`` and
``TARGETS``.  We use a silent build (``make V=0``)::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker build . -f Dockerfile \
    --build-arg TARGETS_PRE=ratpoints \
    --build-arg TARGETS=ratpoints \
    --build-arg USE_MAKEFLAGS="V=0"
  Sending build context to Docker daemon    285MB
  Step 1/28 : ARG BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:latest
  ...
  Step 2/28 : FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
   ---> 549b9b86cb8d
  ...
  Step 25/28 : RUN make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -y -o" ${USE_MAKEFLAGS} ${TARGETS_PRE}
  ...
  make[1]: Entering directory '/sage/build/make'
  sage-logger -p 'sage-spkg -y -o  ratpoints-2.1.3.p5' '/sage/logs/pkgs/ratpoints-2.1.3.p5.log'
  [ratpoints-2.1.3.p5] installing. Log file: /sage/logs/pkgs/ratpoints-2.1.3.p5.log
    [ratpoints-2.1.3.p5] successfully installed.
  make[1]: Leaving directory '/sage/build/make'

  sys	0m0.314s
  Sage build/upgrade complete!
  ...
  ---> 2d06689d39fa
  Successfully built 2d06689d39fa

We can now start a container using the image id shown in the last step::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker run -it 2d06689d39fa bash
  root@fab59e09a641:/sage# ls -l logs/pkgs/
  total 236
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 231169 Mar 26 22:07 config.log
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6025 Mar 26 22:27 ratpoints-2.1.3.p5.log
  root@fab59e09a641:/sage# ls -l local/lib/*rat*
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 177256 Mar 26 22:27 local/lib/libratpoints.a

You can customize the image build process further by editing the
``Dockerfile``.  For example, by default, the generated ``Dockerfile``
configures, builds, and tests Sage.  By deleting or commenting out the
commands for the latter, you can adjust the Dockerfile to stop after
the ``configure`` phase, for example.

``Dockerfile`` is the default filename for Dockerfiles.  You can
change it to any other name, but it is recommended to use
``Dockerfile`` as a prefix, such as ``Dockerfile-debian-standard``.
It should be placed within the tree rooted at the current directory
(``.``); if you want to put it elsewhere, you need to learn about
details of "Docker build contexts".

Note that in contrast to the workflow described in the above sections,
the ``Dockerfile`` **copies** a snapshot of your Sage worktree into
the build container, using ``ADD`` commands, instead of mounting the
directory into it.  This copying is subject to the exclusions in the
``.gitignore`` file (via a symbolic link from ``.dockerignore``).
Therefore, only the sources are copied, but not your configuration
(such as the file ``config.status``), nor the ``$SAGE_LOCAL`` tree,
nor any other build artifacts.

Because of this, you can build a Docker image using the generated
``Dockerfile`` from your main Sage development tree.  It does not have
to be distclean to start, and the build will not write into it at all.
Hence, you can continue editing and compiling your Sage development
tree even while Docker builds are running.


Debugging a portability bug using Docker
----------------------------------------

Let us do another partial build.  We choose a package that we suspect
might not work on all platforms, ``surf``, which was marked as
"experimental" in 2017::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker build . -f Dockerfile \
    --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:latest \
    --build-arg NUMPROC=4 \
    --build-arg TARGETS_PRE=surf \

  Sending build context to Docker daemon    285MB

Note that no image id is shown at the end; the build failed, and no
image is created.  However, the container in which the last step of
the build was attempted exists::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker ps -a |head -n3
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS

We can copy the build directory from the container for inspection::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker cp 61833bea6a6d:/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build ubuntu-build
  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ ls ubuntu-build/surf*/src

Alternatively, we can use ``docker commit`` as explained earlier to
create an image from the container::

Automatic Docker-based build testing using tox
----------------------------------------------

`tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a Python package that
is widely used for automating tests of Python projects.

If you are using Docker locally, install ``tox`` for use with your system Python,
for example using::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ pip install --user tox

If you run Docker-in-Docker on GitHub Codespaces using our dev container
configuration `.devcontainer/tox-docker-in-docker
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/tox-docker-in-docker>`_,
``tox`` is already installed.

Sage provides a sophisticated tox configuration in the file
:sage_root:`tox.ini` for the purpose of portability testing.

A tox "environment" is identified by a symbolic name composed of
several `Tox "factors"
<https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#complex-factor-conditions>`_.

The **technology** factor describes how the environment is run:

- ``docker`` builds a Docker image as described above.

- ``local`` runs testing on the host OS instead.  We explain this
  technology in a later section.

The next two factors determine the host system configuration: The
**system factor** describes a base operating system image.

- Examples are ``ubuntu-focal``, ``debian-buster``,
  ``archlinux-latest``, ``fedora-30``, ``slackware-14.2``,
  ``centos-7-i386``, and ``ubuntu-bionic-arm64``.

- See :sage_root:`tox.ini` for a complete list, and to which images
  on Docker hub they correspond.

The **packages factor** describes a list of system packages to be
installed on the system before building Sage:

- ``minimal`` installs the system packages known to Sage to provide
  minimal prerequisites for bootstrapping and building the Sage
  distribution.  This corresponds to the packages ``_bootstrap`` and
  ``_prereq``.

- ``standard`` additionally installs all known system packages that
  are equivalent to standard packages of the Sage distribution, for
  which the mechanism ``spkg-configure.m4`` is implemented.
  This corresponds to the packages listed by::

    [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ sage --package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 :standard:

- ``maximal`` does the same for all standard and optional packages.
  This corresponds to the packages listed by::

    [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ sage --package list :standard: :optional:

The factors are connected by a hyphen to name a system configuration,
such as ``debian-buster-standard`` and ``centos-7-i386-minimal``.

Finally, the **configuration** factor (which is allowed to be empty)
controls how the ``configure`` script is run.

The factors are connected by a hyphen to name a tox environment.  (The
order of the factors does not matter; however, for consistency and
because the ordered name is used for caching purposes, we recommend to
use the factors in the listed order.)

To run an environment::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ tox -e docker-slackware-14.2-minimal
  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard

Arbitrary extra arguments to ``docker build`` can be supplied through
the environment variable ``EXTRA_DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS``.  For example,
for a non-silent build (``make V=1``), use::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ EXTRA_DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--build-arg USE_MAKEFLAGS=\"V=1\"" \
    tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard

By default, tox uses ``TARGETS_PRE=all-sage-local`` and
``TARGETS=build``, leading to a complete build of Sage without the
documentation.  If you pass positional arguments to tox (separated
from tox options by ``--``), then both ``TARGETS_PRE`` and ``TARGETS``
are set to these arguments.  In this way, you can build some specific
packages instead of all of Sage, for example::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ tox -e docker-centos-8-standard -- ratpoints

If the build succeeds, this will create a new image named
``sage-centos-8-standard-with-targets:9.1.beta9-431-gca4b5b2f33-dirty``,
where

- the image name is derived from the tox environment name and the
  suffix ``with-targets`` expresses that the ``make`` targets given in
  ``TARGETS`` have been built;

- the tag name describes the git revision of the source tree as per
  ``git describe --dirty``.

You can ask for tox to create named intermediate images as well.  For
example, to create the images corresponding to the state of the OS
after installing all system packages (``with-system-packages``) and
the one just after running the ``configure`` script (``configured``)::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ DOCKER_TARGETS="with-system-packages configured with-targets" \
    tox -e docker-centos-8-standard -- ratpoints
  ...
  Sending build context to Docker daemon ...
  Step 1/109 : ARG BASE_IMAGE=fedora:latest
  Step 2/109 : FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} as with-system-packages
  ...
  Step 109/109 : RUN yum install -y zlib-devel || echo "(ignoring error)"
  ...
  Successfully built 4bb14c3d5646
  Successfully tagged sage-centos-8-standard-with-system-packages:9.1.beta9-435-g861ba33bbc-dirty
  Sending build context to Docker daemon ...
  ...
  Successfully tagged sage-centos-8-standard-configured:9.1.beta9-435-g861ba33bbc-dirty
  ...
  Sending build context to Docker daemon ...
  ...
  Successfully tagged sage-centos-8-standard-with-targets:9.1.beta9-435-g861ba33bbc-dirty

Let's verify that the images are available::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage]$ docker images | head
  REPOSITORY                                    TAG                               IMAGE ID

  sage-centos-8-standard-with-system-packages   9.1.beta9-435-g861ba33bbc-dirty   4bb14c3d5646
  ...


Automatic build testing on the host OS using tox -e local-direct
----------------------------------------------------------------

The ``local`` technology runs testing on the host OS instead.

In contrast to the ``docker`` technology, it does not make a copy of
the source tree.  It is most straightforward to run it from a
separate, distclean git worktree.

Let us try a first variant of the ``local`` technology, the tox
environment called ``local-direct``.  Because all builds with tox
begin by bootstrapping the source tree, you will need autotools and
other prerequisites installed in your system.  See
``build/pkgs/_bootstrap/distros/*.txt`` for a list of system packages that
provide these prerequisites.

We start by creating a fresh (distclean) git worktree::

  [mkoeppe@sage sage] git worktree add worktree-local
  [mkoeppe@sage sage] cd worktree-local
  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local] ls
  COPYING.txt ... Makefile ... configure.ac ... src tox.ini

Again we build only a small package.  Build targets can be passed as
positional arguments (separated from tox options by ``--``)::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local] tox -e local-direct -- ratpoints
  local-direct create: /Users/mkoeppe/.../worktree-local/.tox/local-direct
  local-direct run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='2211987514'
  ...

  configure.ac:328: installing 'config/compile'
  configure.ac:113: installing 'config/config.guess'
  ...
  checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
  checking whether build environment is sane... yes
  ...
  sage-logger -p 'sage-spkg -y -o  ratpoints-2.1.3.p5' '.../worktree-local/logs/pkgs/ratpoints-2.1.3.p5.log'

    [ratpoints-2.1.3.p5] successfully installed.
  ...
    local-direct: commands succeeded
    congratulations :)

Let's investigate what happened here::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local]$ ls -la
  total 2576
  drwxr-xr-x  35 mkoeppe  staff    1120 Mar 26 22:20 .

  drwxr-xr-x   4 mkoeppe  staff     128 Mar 26 20:46 upstream

There is no ``local`` subdirectory.  This is part of a strategy to
keep the source tree clean to the extent possible. In particular:

- ``tox`` configured the build to use a separate ``$SAGE_LOCAL``
  hierarchy in a directory under the tox environment directory
  ``.tox/local-direct``.  It created a symbolic link ``prefix`` that
  points there, for convenience::

    [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local]$ ls -l prefix/lib/*rat*
    -rw-r--r--  1 mkoeppe  staff  165968 Mar 26 20:46 prefix/lib/libratpoints.a

- Likewise, it created a separate ``logs`` directory, again under the
  tox environment directory, and a symbolic link.

This makes it possible for advanced users to test several ``local``
tox environments (such as ``local-direct``) out of one worktree.  However, because a
build still writes configuration scripts and build artifacts (such as
``config.status``) into the worktree, only one ``local`` build can run
at a time in a given worktree.

The tox environment directory will be reused for the next ``tox`` run,
which will therefore do an incremental build.  To start a fresh build,
you can use the ``-r`` option.

Automatic build testing on the host OS with best-effort isolation using tox -e local
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``tox -e local`` (without ``-direct``) attempts a best-effort
isolation from the user's environment as follows:

- All environment variables are set to standard values; with the
  exception of ``MAKE`` and ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS``.  In particular,
  ``PATH`` is set to just ``/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin``; it does
  not include ``/usr/local/bin``.


Note, however, that various packages have build scripts that use
``/usr/local`` or other popular file system locations such as
``/opt/sfw/``.  Therefore, the isolation is not complete.  Using
``/usr/local`` is considered standard behavior.  On the other hand, we
consider a package build script that inspects other file system
locations to be a bug of the Sage distribution, which should be
reported and fixed on a ticket.


Automatic build testing on macOS with a best-effort isolated installation of Homebrew
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XCode on macOS does not provide the prerequisites for bootstrapping
the Sage distribution.  A good way to install them is using the
Homebrew package manager.

In fact, Sage provides a tox environment that automatically installs
an isolated copy of Homebrew with all prerequisites for bootstrapping::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local]$ tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal -- lrslib
  local-homebrew-macos-minimal create: .../worktree-local/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal
  local-homebrew-macos-minimal run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='4246149402'

  ==> Caveats

  gettext is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into .../worktree-local/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal/homebrew,
  because macOS provides the BSD gettext library & some software gets confused if both are in the library path.

  If you need to have gettext first in your PATH run:
    echo 'export PATH=".../worktree-local/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal/homebrew/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

  For compilers to find gettext you may need to set:
    export LDFLAGS="-L.../worktree-local/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal/homebrew/opt/gettext/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I.../worktree-local/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal/homebrew/opt/gettext/include"

    local-homebrew-macos-minimal: commands succeeded
    congratulations :)

The tox environment uses the subdirectory ``homebrew`` of the
environment directory ``.tox/local-homebrew-macos-minimal`` as the
Homebrew prefix.  This installation does not interact in any way with
a Homebrew installation in ``/usr/local`` that you may have.

The test script sets the ``PATH`` to the ``bin`` directory of the
Homebrew prefix, followed by ``/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin``.  It
then uses the script :sage_root:`.homebrew-build-env` to set
environment variables so that Sage's build scripts will find
"keg-only" packages such as ``gettext``.

The ``local-homebrew-macos-minimal`` environment does not install
Homebrew's ``python3`` package.  It uses XCode's ``/usr/bin/python3``
as system python.  However, because various packages are missing
that Sage considers as dependencies, Sage builds its own copy of
these packages and of ``python3``.

The ``local-homebrew-macos-standard`` environment additionally
installs (in its separate isolated copy of Homebrew) all Homebrew
packages known to Sage for which the ``spkg-configure.m4`` mechanism
is implemented; this is similar to the ``docker-standard`` tox
environments described earlier.  In particular it installs and uses
Homebrew's ``python3`` package.

By using configuration factors, more variants can be tested.
The ``local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3_xcode`` environment
installs the same packages, but uses XCode's ``/usr/bin/python3``.

The ``local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3_pythonorg`` expects an
installation of Python 3.10 in
``/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework``; this is where the binary
packages provided by python.org install themselves.


Automatic build testing with a best-effort isolated installation of Conda
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sage provides environments ``local-conda-forge-standard`` and
``local-conda-forge-minimal`` that create isolated installations of
Miniconda in the subdirectory ``conda`` of the environment directory.
They do not interact in any way with other installations of Anaconda
or Miniconda that you may have on your system.

The environments use the conda-forge channel and use the ``python``
package and the compilers from this channel.


Options for build testing with the local technology
---------------------------------------------------

The environments using the ``local`` technology can be customized
by setting environment variables.

- If ``SKIP_SYSTEM_PKG_INSTALL`` is set to ``1`` (or ``yes``),
  then all steps of installing system packages are skipped in this run.
  When reusing a previously created tox environment, this option can
  save time and also give developers more control for experiments
  with system packages.

- If ``SKIP_BOOTSTRAP`` is set to ``1`` (or ``yes``), then the
  bootstrapping phase is skipped.  When reusing a previously created
  tox environment, this option can save time.

- If ``SKIP_CONFIGURE`` is set to ``1`` (or ``yes``), then the
  ``configure`` script is not run explicitly.  When reusing a
  previously created tox environment, this option can save time.
  (The ``Makefile`` may still rerun configuration using
  ``config.status --recheck``.)

The ``local`` technology also defines a special target ``bash``:
Instead of building anything with ``make``, it just starts an
interactive shell.  For example, in combination with the above
options::

  [mkoeppe@sage worktree-local]$ SKIP_SYSTEM_PKG_INSTALL=yes SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1 SKIP_CONFIGURE=1 tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal -- bash


Automatic testing on multiple platforms on GitHub Actions
=========================================================

The Sage source tree includes a configuration (a suite of scripts) for GitHub
Actions that runs portability tests on a multitude of platforms
using the Docker-based testing framework described above, on every push of a
tag (but not of a branch) to a repository for which GitHub Actions are enabled.
In particular, it runs on our main repository sagemath/sage on every release
tag.

This is defined in the files

- :sage_root:`.github/workflows/ci-linux.yml` CI Linux workflow
- :sage_root:`.github/workflows/docker.yml` called by CI Linux workflow
- :sage_root:`.github/workflows/ci-macos.yml` CI macOS workflow
- :sage_root:`.github/workflows/macos.yml` called by CI macOS workflow

GitHub Actions runs these build jobs on 2-core machines with 7 GB of
RAM memory and 14 GB of SSD disk space, cf.
`here <https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources>`_,
and has a time limit of 6h per job. This could be just barely enough for a
typical ``minimal`` build followed by ``make ptest`` to succeed; for
added robustness, we split it into two jobs. Our workflow stores
Docker images corresponding to various build phases within these two
jobs on `GitHub Packages <https://github.com/orgs/sagemath/packages?repo_name=sage>`_ (ghcr.io).

Build logs can be inspected during the run and become available as
"artifacts" when all jobs of the workflow have finished.  Each job
generates one tarball.  "Annotations" highlight certain top-level
errors or warnings issued during the build.

.. NOTE::

    The list of the default platforms tested by the CI Linux workflow is in the
    item ``tox_system_factors`` of the file
    :sage_root:`.github/workflows/docker.yml`.  However, do not modify the list
    directly. Instead use the command ::

    $ tox -e update_docker_platforms

    to update the list (and this documentation accordingly) from the "Master list
    of platforms tested in CI Linux" (search for ``DEFAULT_SYSTEM_FACTORS``) in
    :sage_root:`tox.ini`, which dictates how to create testing environments for
    all platforms and build modes.

In addition to these automatic runs in our main repository, all Sage
developers can run the same tests on GitHub Actions in their personal
forks of the Sage repository. To prepare this, `enable GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#managing-github-actions-permissions-for-your-repository>`_
in your fork of the Sage repository.

As usual we assume that ``origin`` is the name of the remote
corresponding to your GitHub fork of the Sage repository::

  $ git remote -v | grep origin
  origin         https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage.git (fetch)
  origin         https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage.git (push)

Then the following procedure triggers a run of tests with the default set
of system configurations.

- Push your branch to ``origin`` (your fork).

- Go to the Actions tab of your fork and select the workflow "CI Linux"
  or "CI macOS".

- Click on "Run workflow" above the list of workflow runs and select
  your branch as the branch on which the workflow will run.

For more information, see the `GitHub documentation
<https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow>`_.

Alternatively, you can trigger CI workflows at the same time by creating and
pushing a custom tag as follows.

- Create a ("lightweight", not "annotated") tag with an arbitrary
  name, say ``ci`` (for "Continuous Integration")::

    git tag -f ci

- Then push the tag to your GitHub repository::

    git push -f origin ci

In both commands, the "force" option (``-f``) allows overwriting a
previous tag of that name.

The `workflow for Linux portability CI
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/workflows/docker.yml>`_ is convenient
when you are fixing issues for specific Linux platforms. The "Run workflow"
button allows you to precisely select the platforms and the build targets
tailored for the issues you are tackling. This is for advanced developers, who
read the workflow script :sage_root:`.github/workflows/docker.yml` in detail.

When any CI workflow has been triggered, you can inspect it
by using the workflow status page in the "Actions" tab of your
repository.

Here is how to read it.  Each of the items in the left pane represents
a full build of Sage on a particular system configuration.  A test
item in the left pane is marked with a green checkmark in the left
pane if ``make build doc-html`` finished without error.  (It also runs
package testsuites and the Sage doctests but failures in these are not
reflected in the left pane; see below.)

Clicking an item in the left pane opens a log viewer on the right. The most
important item in the log viewer is the step "Configure and build Sage ...",
where you see full logs generated from the workflow. If the job failed, these
logs show at what point in the build process the failure occurred.

.. NOTE::

    The massive volume of logs would look overwhelming at first sight. Here are
    some guides:

    - ``► ...``: These are commands executed by the workflow :sage_root:`.github/workflows/docker.yml`.
    - ``docker-...:``: These are commands executed by Tox :sage_root:`tox.ini`.
    - ``#xx ...`` where ``xx`` is a number: These show the commands executed by
      Docker building Sage with the Dockerfile generated by
      :sage_root:`.ci/write-dockerfile.sh`.
    - Other lines are output from the commands executed by the workflow, Tox,
      or Docker. The majority of these will likely be the output from the Sage
      build process.

The "Artifacts" pane on the right offers archives of the logs for download.

The "Annotations" pane on the right shows errors, warnings or notices:

* Red "check failure" annotations appear for each log file that
  contains a build error. For example, you might see::

    docker (fedora-28, standard)
    artifacts/logs-commit-8ca1c2df8f1fb4c6d54b44b34b4d8320ebecb164-tox-docker-fedora-28-standard/logs/pkgs/sagetex-3.4.log#L1
    ==== ERROR IN LOG FILE artifacts/logs-commit-8ca1c2df8f1fb4c6d54b44b34b4d8320ebecb164-tox-docker-fedora-28-standard/logs/pkgs/sagetex-3.4.log ====

* Yellow "check warning" annotations. There are 2 types of these:

  a) Package testsuite or Sage doctest failures, like the following::

       docker (fedora-30, standard)
       artifacts/logs-commit-8ca1c2df8f1fb4c6d54b44b34b4d8320ebecb164-tox-docker-fedora-30-standard/logs/ptest.log#L1
       ==== TESTSUITE FAILURE IN LOG FILE artifacts/logs-commit-8ca1c2df8f1fb4c6d54b44b34b4d8320ebecb164-tox-docker-fedora-30-standard/logs/ptest.log ====

  b) Notices from ./configure about not finding equivalent system
     packages, like the following::

       docker (fedora-31, standard)
       artifacts/logs-commit-8ca1c2df8f1fb4c6d54b44b34b4d8320ebecb164-tox-docker-fedora-31-standard/config.log#L1
       configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc cddlib cmake eclib ecm fflas_ffpack flint fplll givaro gp

Clicking on the annotations does not take you to a very useful
place. To view details, click on one of the items in the pane. This
changes the right pane to a log viewer.



The ``docker`` workflows automatically push images to
``ghcr.io``.  You find them in the Packages tab of your
GitHub repository.

In order to pull them for use on your computer, you need to first
generate a Personal Access Token providing the ``read:packages`` scope
as follows.  Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new (this may
prompt you for your GitHub password).  As "Note", type "Access
ghcr.io"; then in "Select scopes", select the checkbox
for ``read:packages``.  Finally, push the "Generate token" button at
the bottom.  This will lead to a page showing your token, such as
``de1ec7ab1ec0ffee5ca1dedbaff1ed0ddba11``.  Copy this token and paste
it to the command line::

  $ echo de1ec7ab1ec0ffee5ca1dedbaff1ed0ddba11 | docker login ghcr.io --username YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME

where you replace the token by your token, of course, and
``YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`` by your GitHub username.

Now you can pull the image and run it::

  $ docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/sage/sage-fedora-31-standard-configured:f4bd671
  $ docker run -it ghcr.io/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/sage/sage-fedora-31-standard-configured:f4bd671 bash


Using our pre-built Docker images published on ghcr.io
======================================================

Our portability CI on GitHub Actions builds `Docker images
<https://github.com/orgs/sagemath/packages?tab=packages&q=with-targets-optional>`_
for all tested Linux platforms (and system package configurations) and
makes them available on `GitHub Packages
<https://github.com/orgs/sagemath/packages?repo_name=sage>`_ (ghcr.io).

This makes it easy for developers to debug problems that showed up in
the build logs for a given platform. These images are not intended for production
deployment.

The image version corresponding to the latest development release
receives the additional Docker tag ``dev``, see for example the Docker
image for the platform `ubuntu-focal-standard
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/pkgs/container/sage%2Fsage-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets-optional>`_. Thus,
for example, the following command will work::

  $ docker run -it ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets-optional:dev bash
  Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets-optional:dev' locally

  sage:

Images whose names end with the suffix ``-with-targets-optional`` are
the results of full builds and a run of ``make ptest``. They also
contain a copy of the source tree and the full logs of the build and
test.

Also `smaller images corresponding to earlier build stages
<https://github.com/orgs/sagemath/packages?tab=packages&q=sage-debian-bullseye-standard>`_
are available:

* ``-with-system-packages`` provides a system installation with system packages
  installed, no source tree,

* ``-configured`` contains the source tree (:envvar:`SAGE_ROOT`) and has
  completed the bootstrapping phase and the run of the ``configure`` script,

* ``-with-targets-pre`` contains the source tree and a full installation of all
  non-Python packages (:envvar:`SAGE_LOCAL`),

* ``-with-targets`` contains the source tree and a full installation of Sage,
  including the HTML documentation, but ``make ptest`` has not been run yet.

Note that some of these images are outdated due to build errors.
Moreover, standard and minimal images are discontinued.

Using our pre-built Docker images for development in VS Code
============================================================

`VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ is very
convenient for developing with Docker containers thanks to the `Visual
Studio Code Dev Containers
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers>`_ extension.

If the extension is not already installed, then in VS Code, click the
"Extension" icon on the left (or press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`X`;
on macOS, :kbd:`Command` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`X`) to open a list of
extensions. Search for "Dev Containers" and install it.

The extension needs a ``devcontainer.json`` configuration file to work. Sage
provides sample ``devcontainer.json`` configuration files
`$SAGE_ROOT/.devcontainer/*/devcontainer.json
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/>`_ for this
purpose.

If you open the sage folder in VS Code, it may prompt you whether you would like to open the current
directory in the dev container (yes).  If it does not, use the command palette
(:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`P`), enter the command "Dev Containers:
Reopen Folder in Container" , and hit :kbd:`Enter`.

If the above ``code .`` command does not work, start VS Code as a regular
application, then in the command palette of VS Code, enter "Dev Containers:
Open Folder in Container", and hit :kbd:`Enter`, and choose the directory
``$SAGE_ROOT`` of your local Sage repository.

VS Code then prompts you to choose a dev container configuration.
For example, choose "ubuntu-jammy-standard" `.devcontainer/portability-ubuntu-jammy-standard/devcontainer.json
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/portability-ubuntu-jammy-standard/devcontainer.json>`_,
which uses the Docker image based on ``ubuntu-jammy-standard``, the most recent
development version of Sage (``dev`` tag), and a full installation of
the Sage distribution (``with-targets``). Other dev container configurations
are described below.

Once VS Code starts configuring the dev container, by clicking on "show log",
you can see what it does:

- It pulls the prebuilt image from ghcr.io (via
  :sage_root:`.devcontainer/portability-Dockerfile`);
  note that these are multi-gigabyte images, so it may take a while.

- As part of the "onCreateCommand", it installs additional system packages to
  support VS Code and for development.

- Then, as part of the "updateContentCommand", it bootstraps and
  configures the source tree and starts to build Sage from source,
  reusing the installation (:envvar:`SAGE_LOCAL`, :envvar:`SAGE_VENV`)
  from the prebuilt image.

After VS Code finished configuring the dev container (when the message "Done.
Press any key to close the terminal." appears in the terminal named
"Configuring"), your local Sage repository at ``$SAGE_ROOT`` is available in
the container at the directory ``/workspaces/<repository name>``. To use Sage
in a terminal, `open a new terminal in VS Code
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics>`_, type ``./sage`` and hit
:kbd:`Enter`.

.. NOTE::

   Your Sage at ``$SAGE_ROOT`` was configured and rebuilt inside the dev
   container. In particular, ``$SAGE_ROOT/venv``, ``$SAGE_ROOT/prefix``, and
   (possibly) ``$SAGE_ROOT/logs`` will be symbolic links that work inside the dev
   container, but not in your local file system; and also the script
   ``$SAGE_ROOT/sage`` will not work. Hence after working with the dev container,
   you will want to remove ``logs`` if it is a symbolic link, and rerun the
   ``configure`` script.

The Sage source tree contains premade configuration files for all platforms
for which our portability CI builds Docker images, both in the ``minimal`` and
``standard`` system package configurations. The configuration files can be
generated using the command ``tox -e update_docker_platforms`` (see
:sage_root:`tox.ini` for environment variables that take effect).

You can edit a copy of the configuration file to change to a different platform, another
version, or build stage.  After editing the configuration file, run "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container" from the command
palette. See the `VS Code devcontainer.json reference
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference>`_
and the `GitHub introduction to dev containers
<https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/introduction-to-dev-containers>`_
for more information.

In addition to the
``$SAGE_ROOT/.devcontainer/portability-.../devcontainer.json`` files, Sage also
provides several other sample ``devcontainer.json`` configuration files in the
directory :sage_root:`.devcontainer`.

Files named ``$SAGE_ROOT/.devcontainer/develop-.../devcontainer.json`` configure
containers from a public Docker image that provides SageMath and then updates the
installation of SageMath in this container by building from the current source tree.

- `develop-docker-computop/devcontainer.json
  <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/develop-docker-computop/devcontainer.json>`_
  configures a container with the `Docker image from the 3-manifolds
  project <https://hub.docker.com/r/computop/sage/>`_, providing
  SnapPy, Regina, PHCPack, etc.

After VS Code finished configuring the
dev container, to use Sage in a terminal, `open a new terminal in VS Code
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics>`_, type ``./sage`` and hit
:kbd:`Enter`.

Files named ``$SAGE_ROOT/.devcontainer/downstream-.../devcontainer.json`` configure
containers with an installation of downstream packages providing SageMath from a
package manager (``downstream-archlinux-...``, ``downstream-conda-forge``;
see also `the _sagemath dummy package <../reference/spkg/_sagemath.html>`_),
or from a public Docker image that provides SageMath (``docker-cocalc``, ``docker-computop``).
These ``devcontainer.json`` configuration files are useful for testing
user scripts on these deployments of SageMath. You may also find it
useful to copy these configurations into your own projects (they should
work without change) or to adapt them to your needs.

- `downstream-archlinux-latest/devcontainer.json
  <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/downstream-archlinux-latest/devcontainer.json>`_
  configures a container with an installation of `Arch Linux
  <https://archlinux.org/>`_ and its SageMath package. (The suffix ``latest``
  indicates the most recent version of Arch Linux as available on Docker Hub.)

- `downstream-conda-forge-latest/devcontainer.json
  <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/downstream-conda-forge-latest/devcontainer.json>`_
  configures a container with an installation of conda-forge and its SageMath package.

- `downstream-docker-cocalc/devcontainer.json
  <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/downstream-docker-cocalc/devcontainer.json>`_
  configures a container with `the CoCalc Docker image <https://doc.cocalc.com/docker-image.html>`_.

- `downstream-docker-computop/devcontainer.json
  <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/.devcontainer/develop-docker-computop/devcontainer.json>`_
  configures a container with the `Docker image from the 3-manifolds
  project <https://hub.docker.com/r/computop/sage/>`_, providing
  SnapPy, Regina, PHCPack, etc.

After VS Code finished configuring the
dev container, to use Sage in a terminal, `open a new terminal in VS Code
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics>`_, type ``sage`` and hit
:kbd:`Enter`. (Do not use ``./sage``; this will not work because the source
tree is not configured.)
