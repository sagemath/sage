# gf2x builds fine without symlinks enabled, but enabling them confuses the mingw gcc

# fine when `ln -s` just copies the file to the new destination, but fails when it creates
# a symlink that is only understandable to MSYS-build software, which the compiler
# intentionally isn't)

# Unset MSYS to turn off symlinks so we don't run into that problem
