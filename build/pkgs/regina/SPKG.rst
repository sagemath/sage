regina: Low-dimensional topology: triangulations, knots, links, normal surfaces, angle structures
=================================================================================================

Description
-----------

Regina is a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists, with a focus on triangulations, knots and links, normal surfaces, and angle structures.

For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition, connected sum decomposition and Hakenness testing, comes with a rich database of census manifolds, and incorporates the SnapPea kernel for working with hyperbolic manifolds. For 4-manifolds, it offers a range of combinatorial and algebraic tools, plus support for normal hypersurfaces. For knots and links, Regina can perform combinatorial manipulation, compute knot polynomials, and work with several import/export formats.
