 Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software: Giac integration
==============================================================================

This pip-installable source distribution ``sagemath-giac`` is a small
optional distribution for use with ``sagemath-standard``.

It provides a Cython interface to the ``libgiac`` library for the
purpose of symbolic integration and certain Groebner basis
calculations.

To install this as part of the SageMath distribution, you can either
pass ``--enable-sagemath_giac`` to ``./configure``, or run ``make
sagemath_giac`` later (after building Sage) at your convenience.

For other types of installations (meson, pip, linux distro, etc.) you
can download the latest release from the Github repository,

* https://github.com/sagemath/sagemath-giac/

and follow the instructions in its ``README.rst``.
