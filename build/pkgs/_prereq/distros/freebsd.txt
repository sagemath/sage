# This file, build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/freebsd.txt, contains names of
# FreeBSD packages needed for installation of Sage from source.
#

# An easier way, if the ports tree has been installed on your machine is:
# $ cd /usr/ports/math/sage
# $ sudo make install-missing-packages
#
# One package per line. No need to escape special characters.
# Everything on a line after a # character is ignored.
#
gmake
automake
bash
dash
python # python metaport for bootstrapping the build
