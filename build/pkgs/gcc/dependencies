NOTE: all dependencies of GCC must be order-only dependencies
(appearing after the | symbol). This is to prevent rebuilds of GCC
even if the dependencies are updated. There is logic in the top-level
configure file to ensure that GCC is rebuilt anyway if required. See
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24907
