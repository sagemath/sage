# Use newer version of config.guess and config.sub (see Github issue #19713)
cp "$SAGE_ROOT"/config/config.* .

# Note: The following doesn't work with spaces in `$SAGE_LOCAL`, but we don't
#       support that anyway, since many upstream packages don't.
#       On the other hand, the only package GLPK uses that Sage provides is 
#       GMP, so we should just use `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP`
#
#       Turns out that (as of version 4.55)
#          `configure` doesn't support specifying the location of the GMP
#          library to use; only `--with-gmp[=yes]` or `--with-gmp=no`
#          are valid options.  So we *have to* add Sage's include and
#          library directories to `CPPFLAGS` (done here) and `LDFLAGS`
#          (already the default):
CPPFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include $CPPFLAGS"
