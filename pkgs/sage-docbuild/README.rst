SageMath fully supports all major Linux distributions, recent versions of macOS, and Windows (using Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The traditional and recommended way to install SageMath is from source via Sage-the-distribution (https://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html).  Sage-the-distribution first builds a large number of open source packages from source (unless it finds suitable versions installed in the system) and then installs the Sage Library (sagelib, implemented in Python and Cython).


About this pip-installable source distribution
----------------------------------------------

This is the build system of the Sage documentation, based on Sphinx.
