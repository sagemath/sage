# Source this to set CPUTHREADS (the number of apparent cores) and RAMTHREADS
# (free RAM divided by the maximum amount needed per thread typically)
# From this this script infers reasonable defaults for SAGE_NUM_THREADS and
# MAKEFLAGS.

# We do exactly the same for CPUTHREADS_DOCBUILD, RAMTHREADS_DOCBUILD,
# SAGE_NUM_THREADS_DOCBUILD, MAKEFLAGS_DOCBUILD. As the docbuild needs
# substantially more RAM as of May 2018.
