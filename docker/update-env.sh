# The maintainer of the CI environment, e.g., the people administrating the
# SageMath account on gitlab.com, can decide to inject an arbitrary
# base64-encoded script early into the CI execution. The script has access to
# all the CI variables, e.g., to find out which job is being executed, and
# it could do things such as "exit 1" to fail early, or "git merge" a fix for a
# known bug in CI. The CI_MONKEY_PATCH could of course also curl a more
# complicated script and execute that.
